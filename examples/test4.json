    "output": "Gonzalo Fonseca was a Uruguayan sculptor and painter born on July 2, 1922, in Montevideo, Uruguay. He studied architecture at the University of Montevideo before moving to Paris in 1950, where he became increasingly interested in sculpture. Fonseca's work is often characterized by his use of stone and his interest in pre-Columbian and other ancient forms of art. He also explored the relationship between sculpture and architecture, often creating pieces that incorporated elements of both. Fonseca's work has been exhibited in numerous galleries and museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice. He died on April 11, 1997, in Montevideo, Uruguay.",

            "text": "the recorded history of puerto rican women can trace its roots back to the era of the taino, the indigenous people of the caribbean, who inhabited the island that they called borinquen before the arrival of spaniards. during the spanish colonization the cultures and customs of the taino, spanish, african and women from non - hispanic european countries blended into what became the culture and customs of puerto rico. in the early part of the 19th century the women in puerto rico were spanish subjects and had few individual rights. those who belonged to the upper class of the spanish ruling society had better educational opportunities than those who did not. however, there were many women who were already active participants in the labor movement and in the agricultural economy of the island. after puerto rico was ceded to the united states in 1898 as a result of the spanish \u2013 american war, women once again played an integral role in puerto rican society by contributing to the establishment of the university of puerto rico, women ' s suffrage, women ' s rights, civil rights, and to the military of the united states. during the period of industrialization of the 1950s, many women in puerto rico found employment in the needle industry, working as seamstresses in garment factories. many puerto rican families also migrated to the united states in the 1950s. according to the supreme court of puerto rico, women who are born to puerto rican parents in the united states or elsewhere, are considered to be puerto rican citizens. on november 18, 1997, the supreme court of puerto rico, through its ruling in miriam j. ramirez de ferrer v. juan mari bras, reaffirmed the standing existence of the puerto rican citizenship. since 2007, the government of puerto rico has been issuing \" certificates of puerto rican citizenship \" to anyone born in puerto rico or to anyone born outside of puerto rico with at least one parent who was born in puerto rico. currently, women in puerto rico and outside of puerto rico have become active participants in the political and social landscape in both, their homeland and in the continental united states. many of them are involved in the fields that were once limited to the male population and have thus, become influential leaders in their fields. = = pre - columbian era ( up to 1493 ) = = puerto rico was originally called \" borinquen \" by the tainos, which means : \" la tierra del altivo senor \", or \" the land of the mighty lord \", the tainos were one of the arawak peoples of south america and the caribbean, who inhabited the island before the arrival of the spaniards. = = = the taino women = = = the taino women cooked, tended to the needs of the family, their farms and harvested crops. according to ivonne figueroa, editor of the el boricua cultural magazine, women who were mothers carried their babies on their backs on a padded board that was secured to the baby ' s forehead. women did not dedicate themselves solely to cooking and the art of motherhood ; many were also talented artists and made pots, grills, and griddles from river clay by rolling the clay into rope and then layering it to form or shape. taino women also carved drawings ( petroglyphs ) into stone or wood. the taina ' s were also warriors and could join the men in battle against the caribs. according to the spanish conquistadores, the carib indians were cannibals who regularly ate roasted human flesh. archaeological evidence indicates that they limited the consumption of humans to ceremonial occasions. even though the men were allowed to have more than one wife, most of them didn ' t . the cacique ( tribal chief ) was the only person who could afford to sustain multiple wives. it was a great honor for a woman to be married to a cacique. not only did she enjoy a materially superior lifestyle, but her children were held in high esteem. according to an observation made by doctor diego alvarez chanca, who accompanied columbus on his second voyage : the"
