Born in Pontotoc, Mississippi, on July 27, 1942.\u00a0 Memories of his childhood stayed with him throughout his life but never limited his dreams and aspirations.\rLanny served in the U.S. Army in the 1960s as an MP stationed in Germany. He attended Mississippi State University and went on to study at Southern Methodist University focusing primarily on acting and playwriting.\rIn the mid-1970s, Lanny moved to New York City as part of the Broadway cast of Of Mice and Men . Lanny remained a NYC resident for the rest of his life, alternating time between Mississippi and NYC.\rLanny went on to perform in several Broadway productions throughout his life including Sweet Bird of Youth, Inherit the Wind, Joe Turner's Come and Gone, Requiem for a Heavyweight, and also appeared frequently in productions at the Actors Theatre of Louisville and also at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Playboy of the Western World.\rAs an actor on film and television, Lanny appeared in many films, most notably as Big Al in \"Blood In, Blood Out.\" Flaherty also co-starred with Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones in \"Lonesome Dove\" and in Joel and Ethan Coen's \"Miller's Crossing\" with Gabriel Byrne and Marcia Gay Harden. Flaherty co-starred in M. Night Shyamalan's \"Signs\" and in Oliver Stone's \"Natural Born Killers.\" He also appeared in \"Tom and Huck,\" \"Waterworld,\" \"Home Fries,\" and \"Bound By Honor\" among many others.\rLanny wrote many plays over his lifetime . One of his plays \"Showdown at the Adobe Motel\" starred Henry Fonda in his last live performance at the Hartford Stage in Connecticut.\rHe loved the NYC libraries and especially live theater and ballet.\rLanny is survived by his daughter, Sara Suzuki, her husband, Ryosuke Suzuki and twin granddaughters who he loved dearly, and his many friends. He will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved him. The Obituaries are currently being upgraded. Please contact us to report any issues.\nLanny came to New York a few years before I did, and he was very kind to me in my early time here.  I worked with him only once, in the hat shop scene in LITTLE AMERICA.  He was great company and a good guy.  He is missed.

You will understand what sorts of non-factual outputs LLMs\ncan generate, and what is involved in the process of verifying those outputs against Wikipedia. In addition,\nyou will conduct some error analysis of the mistakes your fact-checking model makes.\nDataset and Code\nPlease use up-to-date versions of Python and PyTorch for this assignment.In addition, you will need to\ninstall the transformers package from Hugging Face as well as a few dependencies.\nWe have included a requirements.txt file. You can install the dependencies here by running:\npip install -r requirements.txt Note that you can do this inside a virtual environment.\nIf you are on the CS lab machines, you can use\nsource /lusr/opt/miniconda/bin/activate cs371n-gpu\nto access a virtual environment that should have all dependencies needed for the project.

They conduct human annotation of these steps to understand the perfor-\nmance of systems in different parts of this pipeline (decomposition and fact-checking). The decomposition\nand retrieval have been done for you. The facts you are given are propositions extracted from ChatGPT outputs. These are simple natural\nlanguage sentences. Although FActScore explores different ways of producing these facts from biographies,\nwe use their human-annotated facts for our analysis, to remove any potential errors in this step. These facts\nare then validated against passages that are retrieved by Wikipedia. Each fact is hand-labeled by humans\nwith either \u201cS\u201d for supported, \u201cNS\u201d for not supported, or \u201cIR\u201d for irrelevant.However, we will only predict\nS vs. NS to simplify the task.\nPassages have been retrieved using BM25, a sparse retrieval model (i.e., one that does not use neural\nnetworks). The FActScore paper also discusses experiments with a dense retriever, but passages from this\nmodel only give slightly better performance.\nIn the provided Python code, FactExample stores the examples themselves.

            "text": "Assignment 5: Fact-checking Outputs from ChatGPT\nAcademic Honesty: Please see the course syllabus for information about collaboration in this course.\nWhile you may discuss the assignment with other students, all work you submit must be your own!\nGoals The primary goal with this assignment is to give you hands-on experience analyzing outputs from\nlarge language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. You will understand what sorts of non-factual outputs LLMs\ncan generate, and what is involved in the process of verifying those outputs against Wikipedia. In addition,\nyou will conduct some error analysis of the mistakes your fact-checking model makes.\nDataset and Code\nPlease use up-to-date versions of Python and PyTorch for this assignment.In addition, you will need to\ninstall the transformers package from Hugging Face as well as a few dependencies.\nWe have included a requirements.txt file. You can install the dependencies here by running:\npip install -r requirements.txt Note that you can do this inside a virtual environment.\nIf you are on the CS lab machines, you can use\nsource /lusr/opt/miniconda/bin/activate cs371n-gpu\nto access a virtual environment that should have all dependencies needed for the project. This includes a\nGPU-enabled version of Pytorch; for CPU, you can use:\nsource /lusr/opt/miniconda/bin/activate cs371n-cpu\nData The dataset and overall setup for this project is taken from FActScore (Min et al., 2023).1 FActScore\ninvestigates the problem of detecting errors in biographies of people generated by ChatGPT. The FActScore\npaper explores methods to decompose claims into facts, then searches over Wikipedia to find articles that\n(potentially) support those facts. They conduct human annotation of these steps to understand the perfor-\nmance of systems in different parts of this pipeline (decomposition and fact-checking). The decomposition\nand retrieval have been done for you. The facts you are given are propositions extracted from ChatGPT outputs. These are simple natural\nlanguage sentences. Although FActScore explores different ways of producing these facts from biographies,\nwe use their human-annotated facts for our analysis, to remove any potential errors in this step. These facts\nare then validated against passages that are retrieved by Wikipedia. Each fact is hand-labeled by humans\nwith either \u201cS\u201d for supported, \u201cNS\u201d for not supported, or \u201cIR\u201d for irrelevant.However, we will only predict\nS vs. NS to simplify the task.\nPassages have been retrieved using BM25, a sparse retrieval model (i.e., one that does not use neural\nnetworks). The FActScore paper also discusses experiments with a dense retriever, but passages from this\nmodel only give slightly better performance.\nIn the provided Python code, FactExample stores the examples themselves. These consist of a fact (a string), passages (a list of dicts consisting of a title and text), and the label. Note that the passages themselves\nare not tokenized or preprocessed in any way.\nThe raw fact data is located at data/dev labeled ChatGPT.jsonl and look like this (note: this\nexample is not in the dataset given to you):\n1Original GitHub: https://github.com/shmsw25/FActScore\n1\n{\"input\": \"Question: Tell me a bio of Lanny Flaherty.\",\n\"output\": \"Lanny Flaherty is an American actor born on December 18, 1949, in\nPensacola, Florida.

            "text": "Assignment 5: Fact-checking Outputs from ChatGPT\nAcademic Honesty: Please see the course syllabus for information about collaboration in this course.\nWhile you may discuss the assignment with other students, all work you submit must be your own!\nGoals The primary goal with this assignment is to give you hands-on experience analyzing outputs from\nlarge language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. You will understand what sorts of non-factual outputs LLMs\ncan generate, and what is involved in the process of verifying those outputs against Wikipedia. In addition,\nyou will conduct some error analysis of the mistakes your fact-checking model makes.\nDataset and Code\nPlease use up-to-date versions of Python and PyTorch for this assignment.In addition, you will need to\ninstall the transformers package from Hugging Face as well as a few dependencies.\nWe have included a requirements.txt file. You can install the dependencies here by running:\npip install -r requirements.txt Note that you can do this inside a virtual environment.\nIf you are on the CS lab machines, you can use\nsource /lusr/opt/miniconda/bin/activate cs371n-gpu\nto access a virtual environment that should have all dependencies needed for the project. This includes a\nGPU-enabled version of Pytorch; for CPU, you can use:\nsource /lusr/opt/miniconda/bin/activate cs371n-cpu\nData The dataset and overall setup for this project is taken from FActScore (Min et al., 2023).1 FActScore\ninvestigates the problem of detecting errors in biographies of people generated by ChatGPT. The FActScore\npaper explores methods to decompose claims into facts, then searches over Wikipedia to find articles that\n(potentially) support those facts. They conduct human annotation of these steps to understand the perfor-\nmance of systems in different parts of this pipeline (decomposition and fact-checking). The decomposition\nand retrieval have been done for you. The facts you are given are propositions extracted from ChatGPT outputs. These are simple natural\nlanguage sentences. Although FActScore explores different ways of producing these facts from biographies,\nwe use their human-annotated facts for our analysis, to remove any potential errors in this step. These facts\nare then validated against passages that are retrieved by Wikipedia. Each fact is hand-labeled by humans\nwith either \u201cS\u201d for supported, \u201cNS\u201d for not supported, or \u201cIR\u201d for irrelevant.However, we will only predict\nS vs. NS to simplify the task.\nPassages have been retrieved using BM25, a sparse retrieval model (i.e., one that does not use neural\nnetworks). The FActScore paper also discusses experiments with a dense retriever, but passages from this\nmodel only give slightly better performance.\nIn the provided Python code, FactExample stores the examples themselves. These consist of a fact (a string), passages (a list of dicts consisting of a title and text), and the label. Note that the passages themselves\nare not tokenized or preprocessed in any way.\nThe raw fact data is located at data/dev labeled ChatGPT.jsonl and look like this (note: this\nexample is not in the dataset given to you):\n1Original GitHub: https://github.com/shmsw25/FActScore\n1\n{\"input\": \"Question: Tell me a bio of Lanny Flaherty.\",\n\"output\": \"Lanny Flaherty is an American actor born on December 18, 1949, in\nPensacola, Florida.

            "text": "Natural Born Killers is a 1994 American romantic crime action film directed by Oliver Stone and starring Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr., Tommy Lee Jones, and Tom Sizemore. The film tells the story of two victims of traumatic childhoods who become lovers and mass murderers, and are irresponsibly glorified by the mass media.\nThe film is based on an original screenplay by Quentin Tarantino that was heavily revised by Stone, writer David Veloz, and associate producer Richard Rutowski. Tarantino received a story credit though he subsequently disowned the film. Jane Hamsher, Don Murphy, and Clayton Townsend produced the film, with Arnon Milchan, Thom Mount, and Stone as executive producers. Natural Born Killers was released on August 26, 1994 in the United States, and screened at the Venice Film Festival on August 29, 1994. It was a box office success, grossing $110 million against a production budget of $34 million, but received polarized reviews. Some critics praised the plot, acting, humor, and combination of action and romance, while others found the film overly violent and graphic. Notorious for its violent content and inspiring \"copycat\" crimes, the film was named the eighth most controversial film in history by Entertainment Weekly in 2006. Mickey Knox and his wife Mallory stop at a diner in the New Mexico desert. A duo of rednecks arrive and begin sexually harassing Mallory as she dances by a jukebox. She initially encourages it before beating one of the men viciously. Mickey joins her, and the couple murder everyone in the diner, save one customer, to whom they proudly declare their names before leaving. The couple camp in the desert, and Mallory reminisces about how she met Mickey, a meat deliveryman who serviced her family's household. After a whirlwind romance, Mickey is arrested for grand theft auto and sent to prison; he escapes and returns to Mallory's home. The couple murders Mallory's sexually abusive father and neglectful mother, but spare the life of Mallory's little brother, Kevin. The couple then have an unofficial marriage ceremony on a bridge. Later, Mickey and Mallory hold a woman hostage in their hotel room. Angered by Mickey's desire for a threesome, Mallory leaves, and Mickey rapes the hostage. Mallory drives to a nearby gas station, where she flirts with a mechanic. They begin to have sex on the hood of a car, but after Mallory suffers a flashback of being raped by her father, and the mechanic recognizes her as a wanted murderer, Mallory kills him. The pair continue their killing spree, ultimately claiming 52 victims in New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada. Pursuing them is detective Jack Scagnetti, who became obsessed with mass murderers at the age of eight after having witnessed the murder of his mother at the hand of Charles Whitman. Beneath his heroic fa\u00e7ade, he is also a violent psychopath and has murdered prostitutes in his past. Following the pair's murder spree is self-serving tabloid journalist Wayne Gale, who profiles them on his show American Maniacs, soon elevating them to cult-hero status. Mickey and Mallory become lost in the desert after taking psychedelic mushrooms, and they stumble upon a ranch owned by Warren Red Cloud, a Navajo man who provides them food and shelter. As Mickey and Mallory sleep, Warren, sensing evil in the couple, attempts to exorcise the demon that he perceives in Mickey, chanting over him as he sleeps. Mickey, who has nightmares of his abusive parents, awakens during the exorcism and shoots Warren to death. As the couple flee, they feel inexplicably guilty and come across a giant field of rattlesnakes, where they are badly bitten. They reach a drugstore to purchase snakebite antidote, but the store is sold out. A pharmacist recognizes the couple and triggers an alarm before Mickey kills him. Police arrive shortly after and accost the couple and a shootout ensues. The police end the showdown by beating the couple while a news crew films the action.\nOne y",

            "text": "Reviews\nOliver Stone's \"Natural Born Killers\" might have played even more like a demented nightmare if it hadn't been for the O.J. Simpson case. Maybe Stone meant his movie as a warning about where we were headed, but because of Simpson it plays as an indictment of the way we are now. We are becoming a society more interested in crime and scandal than in anything else - more than in politics and the arts, certainly, and maybe even more than sports, unless crime is our new national sport. If that's true, then Stone's movie is about the latest all-Americans, Mickey and Mallory (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis), two mass murderers who go on a killing spree across America, making sure everybody knows their names, so they get credit for their crimes. (Terrorists always claim \"credit\" rather than \"blame.\") The movie is not simply about their killings, however, but also about the way they electrify the media and exhilarate the public. (One teenager tells the TV cameras, \"Mass murder is wrong. But if I were a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory!\") The boom in courtroom TV has given us long hours to study the faces of famous accused murderers; we have a better view than the jury. Looking into their faces, I sense a curious slackness, an inattention, as if the trial is a mirage, and their thoughts far away. If they're guilty, it's like they're rehearsing their excuses for the crime . If they're innocent, maybe those empty expressions mean the courtroom experience is so alien they can't process it. Not once since he was arraigned have I caught a shot of Simpson looking normal in any way I can understand. His expression always seems to be signifying, \"Yes, but . . .\" Oliver Stone captures this odd emptiness, this moral inattention, in the faces and behavior of Mickey and Mallory. They're on their own frequency. The casting is crucial: Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis are both capable of being frightening, both able to project amorality and disdain as easily as Jack Lemmon projects ingratiation. There is a scene where a lawman is trying to intimidate Lewis, and he throws his cigarette onto the floor of her cell. She steps on it and rubs it out with her bare foot. Set and match. \"Natural Born Killers\" is not so much about the killers, however, as about the feeding frenzy they inspire. During the period of their rampage, they are the most famous people in America, and the media goes nuts. There are Mickey and Mallory fan clubs and T-shirts; tabloid TV is represented by a bloodthirsty journalist played by Robert Downey Jr., who is so thrilled by their fame he almost wants to embrace them. The people Mickey and Mallory touch in the law industry are elated to be handling the case; it gives them a brush with celebrity, and a tantalizing whiff of the brimstone that fascinates some cops. Stone has never been a director known for understatement or subtlety. He'll do anything to get his effect, and that's one of the things I value about him. He understands that celebrity killers have achieved such a bizarre status in America that it's almost impossible to satirize the situation - to get beyond real life. But he goes for broke, in scenes of carnage like a prison riot, which is telecast live while the \"host\" gets caught up in the bloodlust. Yet you do not see as much actual violence as you think you do in this movie; it's more the tone, the attitude, and the breakneck pacing that gives you that impression. Stone is not making a geek show, with closeups of blood and guts. Like all good satirists, he knows that too much realism will weaken his effect. He lets you know he's making a comedy. There's an over-the-top exuberance to the intricate crosscut editing, by Hank Corwin and Brian Berdan, and to the hyperactive camera of Robert Richardson. Stylistically, the film is a cinematic bazaar, combining color and black and white, film and video, 35mm and Super 8, sitcom style and animated cartoons, fiction and newsreels. They're throwing stuff at th",

            "text": "Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, and more recall the set of Oliver Stone's explosive film.\n1993. A clearing in the woods near Chicago, sun shining, puffy clouds. Robert Downey Jr., twenty-seven years old, just a few months past his Best Actor Academy Award nomination for Chaplin, has been high or drunk or asleep for much of the last two months while filming this wild serial-killer movie. Today he has dipped one of the front tails of his white button-down shirt in fake blood and pulled it through the unzipped fly of his suit pants, like a bloody phallus.\n            \u201cOh come on\u2014that\u2019s too much! You\u2019re going too far, Robert.\u201d\n            Oliver Stone, the director of the movie\u2014now on its fifty-fifth of fifty-six days of filming\u2014has won two directing Oscars. He is hollering in his gravelly, perpetually annoyed voice across the clearing at Downey, who opens his mouth to try to explain but is cut off. \u201cYou\u2019re ruining my movie! Forget the dumb dick idea. This isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Stone trails off, grumbling. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some slapstick bullshit.\u201d\n            Downey shrugs at his costar Woody Harrelson, who smirks. Harrelson is bald, having shaved his head two weeks ago on camera after Stone declared that his character, a serial killer, should shave his head while in prison. (It was the first time in his life Harrelson had cut off all his famous blond hair.) Stone had known Harrelson from his work on Cheers, the sitcom in which he played a corn-fed, slow-witted bartender, before casting him as a killer\u2014but Stone did know that Harrelson\u2019s father was a convicted hitman (he murdered a federal judge), and when he looked at Harrelson, the director claimed he could see \u201cmurder in his eyes.\u201d Juliette Lewis, just twenty years old, stands nearby, holding a shotgun. In this scene, Harrelson and Lewis, as Mickey and Mallory Knox\u2014lovers who kill more than fifty people in a cross-country spree\u2014have escaped from prison during a riot. They have a hostage, Downey, in the character of Wayne Gale, a rapacious tabloid-television journalist chasing the biggest story of his life. Natural Born Killers would appear in theaters in the summer of 1994, just as the twenty-four-hour news cycle was tightening its stranglehold on American life. CNN came on the air June 1, 1980, and over the next decade it would create a constant and insatiable desire for instant information\u2014a desire it would then feed, ensuring its own existence. In 1982 the network unveiled CNN2, later renamed Headline News, a circadian presentation of bite-size stories, and by 1989 \u201cthe crawl\u201d appeared along the bottom of the screen (except during commercials), tracking stock prices and later including sports scores and mini-headlines. MTV premiered on August 1, 1981, and its manic, beat-driven, videos\u2014essentially three-minute movies\u2014were redefining the collective attention span. Meanwhile, and perhaps because of all this, Americans were increasingly interested in watching crime and violence on television. Cops, the v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style documentary TV show in which viewers go on ride-alongs with police officers as they bust drug dealers and prostitutes, debuted in March 1989. In 1991, CBS decided to replace its straightforward nightly news program, America Tonight, with a more salacious show called CrimeTime After Primetime. Crime and violence were everywhere in popular culture. The brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents in Beverly Hills in 1989, and we watched them walk in and out of courtrooms for years. In March 1991, Rodney King was savagely beaten by Los Angeles policemen\u2014the footage captured on a nearby resident\u2019s video camera became shock TV\u2014and the ensuing riots in Los Angeles aired live and on repeat for weeks. In 1992, Joey Buttafuoco pleaded guilty to statutory rape after his seventeen-year-old girlfriend, Amy Fisher, shot his wife, Mary Jo Buttafuoco, in the face. \nAs Natural Born Killers was being edited, re-edited, sound-mixed, and eventually",

            "text": "Blood In Blood Out (also known as Bound by Honor and Blood In Blood Out: Bound By Honor) is a 1993 American epic crime drama film directed by Taylor Hackford that has become a cult classic film  among the Mexican-American community. It follows the intertwining lives of three Chicano relatives from 1972 to 1984. They start out as members of a street gang in East Los Angeles, and as dramatic incidents occur, their lives and friendships are forever changed. Blood In Blood Out was filmed in 1991 throughout Los Angeles and inside California's San Quentin State Prison. In 1972, after a violent confrontation with his abusive father, Miklo Velka, a teenager of half-Mexican descent, leaves Las Vegas for East Los Angeles. He moves in with his cousins, Paco and Cruz, who are members of the Vatos Locos gang. Miklo joins the gang following an attack on their rivals, the Tres Puntos. Tres Puntos retaliates by attacking Cruz, permanently damaging his back. When Vatos Locos counterattack the next day, Miklo kills Spider, the leader of Tres Puntos. Fleeing the scene, Paco crashes their car; both he and Miklo are arrested.\nThe cousins' paths diverge: Miklo is imprisoned in San Quentin for murder, Paco volunteers for military service in the Marine Corps in lieu of prison, and Cruz continues his passion for art. Due to his back pain, Cruz becomes addicted to heroin, leading to the accidental overdose of his 12-year-old brother, Juanito. After the Marines, Paco joins the Los Angeles Police Department, eventually working as an undercover detective for them. Meanwhile, Miklo finds that San Quentin is run by three racially defined prison gangs: the Black Guerrilla Army (BGA) led by Bonafide, the Aryan Vanguard led by Red Ryder, and La Onda led by Montana Segura. Popeye, a high-ranking member of La Onda, tries to rape Miklo at knifepoint but is stopped by Montana, who finds Popeye's intentions dishonorable. Miklo learns that the only way into La Onda is by killing an inmate from a rival gang. He forms a rapport with Aryan Vanguard associate Big Al, then kills him in the prison kitchen. Now initiated, Miklo rises through the La Onda ranks, eventually joining its Ruling Council. After serving nine years, Miklo is granted parole. On the outside, disgusted by his menial job, he joins in an armed robbery. The heist goes poorly and Miklo is intercepted by Paco, who tries to persuade him to surrender his weapon and resolve the situation peacefully. Miklo instead starts to flee, and Paco shoots him in the leg. The leg is amputated, and Miklo is sent back to prison.\nMiklo notices that cocaine use is now rampant, driven by competing supplies from the BGA and La Onda council member Carlos. The Aryan Vanguard want to partner with Carlos as his supplier, offering to help Carlos take the BGA out of the cocaine business. Montana, against La Onda being in the drug trade, warns that the Aryans want to start a war between the Black and Chicano inmates. The Council votes in agreement with Montana, resulting in Carlos and some others leaving La Onda to work with the Aryan Vanguard. Carlos has his non-inmate brother, Smokey, bomb the BGA's stash house in the city. Carlos also kills \"Pockets\", who runs the BGA's operation in San Quentin. As Montana feared, the Aryan Vanguard then lets the BGA murder Carlos. With rising hostility between Blacks and Chicanos, Montana and Bonafide meet in the prison yard. Montana convinces Bonafide to agree to a truce if Montana reaches out to La Onda leaders in other prisons to end the violence. The warden grants Montana special permission to visit the prisons and Miklo is left in charge.\nMontana is granted a special request to have his daughter visit him at a prison. Before she arrives, he is stabbed to death by someone from the BGA. Believing the Aryan Vanguard sent forged orders to the hitman, Paco arranges a peace conference between La Onda and the BGA, but Miklo uses the talks to build an alliance with the BGA and plan the joint killin",

Wolfe and managing director Jason Steven Cohen as artistic chiefs. Also involved in the production is actor Kevin Kline, a longtime supporter of the festival and still an active participant in its projects. This is reassuringly signaled by his dual function in \"Measure f or Measure,\" where he serves as star and co-executive producer.\nMore reassuring yet is the high quality of this production. Although there are few signs of the freewheeling boldness that made Akalaitis an exciting heir to Papp's energetic Shakespearean vision, the show has a solidity and cleverness that make it a worthy entry in the marathon. Samuel Taylor Coleridge called \"Measure for Measure\" the most painful of Shakespeare's works, but in modern times its mixture of humor, melodrama, and cynicism has become more popular than it used to be, and the play is produced quite frequently. Michael Rudman, who directed the Delacorte production, doesn't so much blend the comedy's heterogeneous elements as parade them alongside one another, shifting emphasis from one mood to another with postmodern panache.\nIt's not a particularly elegant approach, but \"Measure for Measure\" isn't a particularly elegant play. It is a thought-provoking work, however, and Rudman's conception allows its boisterous ideas to careen and collide with commendable gusto. The performances follow suit, led by Kline as the Duke who attempts to legislate morality in his domain, then observes the results of his experiment by visiting his subjects in a disguise. Andre Braugher has imposing strength as Angelo, the hypocritical deputy who turns the Duke's legal code to his own selfish ends, and Lisa Gay Hamilton is poignantly affecting as Isabella, the young woman whose loyalty to a downtrodden family member leads to sexual blackmail from Angelo.\nOther good performances come from Ethan Phillips as the ridiculous Elbow and Ruben Santiago-Hudson as Lucio, a rake who rivals Angelo for duplicity. Lanny Flaherty makes a vivid impression in the small role of Barnardine, a villain so dissolute that even the hangman",
