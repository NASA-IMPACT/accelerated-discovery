Groundwater plays a significant role in maintaining streamflow, especially during dry periods, acting as a stable source of water. This report synthesizes research findings on the role of groundwater in basin-scale water budgets, focusing on methodologies, case studies, statistical models, and conflicting viewpoints.\\n\\n## Methodologies for Assessing Groundwater's Contribution to Streamflow\\nSeveral methodologies have been developed to quantify groundwater's contribution to streamflow. These include:\\n- **Groundwater-Centric Methods**: These methods focus on direct measurements and modeling of groundwater flow and its interaction with surface water. For instance, the study by Mohan et al. (2023) presents methods for estimating groundwater contributions using environmental flow metrics.\\n- **Integrated Hydrological Models**: Models like SWAT-MODFLOW are used to simulate surface water-groundwater interactions, providing insights into the dynamics of water exchange in basins (Zhang et al., 2022).\\n- **Stable Isotope Analysis**: This method helps in understanding the proportion of streamflow derived from groundwater by analyzing isotopic signatures (Santarosa et al., 2021).\\n\\n## Case Studies Illustrating Groundwater's Importance\\n- **Ukiah Valley Groundwater Basin, California**: A study under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) demonstrated that a significant portion of streamflow in the basin is sustained by groundwater, highlighting its role in maintaining ecological balance (SGMA Case Study).\\n- **Wüstebach Catchment, Germany**: Groundwater contributes up to 74% of streamflow, emphasizing the critical role of groundwater in maintaining streamflow during dry periods (Trust, 2025).\\n- **Huashan Basin, China**: The SWAT-MODFLOW model showed significant groundwater contributions to streamflow, with seasonal variations impacting the exchange rates (Zhang et al., 2022).\\n\\n## Statistical Models and Quantification\\n- **Hybrid Conceptual-Statistical Models**: These models combine conceptual hydrological models with statistical techniques to improve streamflow predictions by accounting for groundwater variations (Kazemi et al., 2023).\\n- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**: Used for enhancing streamflow forecasts by integrating recent discharge measurements, demonstrating improved accuracy in regions with high groundwater influence (Feng et al., 2019).\\n\\n## Conflicting Viewpoints and Evidence\\nWhile there is consensus on the importance of groundwater in sustaining streamflow, some studies highlight potential overestimations of groundwater contributions due to methodological limitations. For example, the use of simplified models may not capture peak-flow variations accurately, leading to discrepancies in groundwater impact assessments (Kazemi et al., 2023).\\n\\n## Gaps and Areas for Future Research\\n- **Data Limitations**: There is a need for more comprehensive datasets that integrate long-term groundwater and surface water interactions.\\n- **Climate Change Impacts**: Future research should focus on how climate change might alter groundwater contributions to streamflow, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.\\n- **Advanced Modeling Techniques**: Development of more sophisticated models that can accurately simulate complex interactions between groundwater and surface water under varying climatic conditions.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nGroundwater is a critical component of basin-scale water budgets, significantly contributing to streamflow across various geographical and climatic contexts. While methodologies and models have advanced, further research is needed to address existing gaps and improve our understanding of groundwater's role in water resource management.\\n\\n## References\\n- Mohan, C.

This exchange contributes substantially to basal water budgets, which in turn modulate the flow of ice streams. The geometry of these sedimentary basins is known to be complex, and the groundwater therein has been observed to vary in salinity due to historic seawater intrusion. However, little is known about the hydraulic properties of subglacial sedimentary basins, and the factors controlling groundwater exfiltration and infiltration. We develop a mathematical model for two-dimensional groundwater flow beneath a marine-terminating ice stream on geological timescales, taking into account the effect of seawater intrusion. We find that seawater may become \"trapped\" in subglacial sedimentary basins, through cycles of grounding line advance and retreat or through \"pockets\" arising from basin geometry. In addition, we estimate the sedimentary basin permeability which reproduces field observations of groundwater salinity profiles from beneath Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica. Exchange of groundwater with the shallow hydrological system is primarily controlled by basin geometry, with groundwater being exfiltrated where the basin becomes shallower and re-infiltrating where it becomes deeper.

Therefore, we analyzed the applicability and performance of four modern deep learning computational models for predictions of groundwater levels. We compare three methods for optimizing the models' hyperparameters, including two surrogate model-based algorithms and a random sampling method. The models were tested using predictions of the groundwater level in Butte County, California, USA, taking into account the temporal variability of streamflow, precipitation, and ambient temperature. Our numerical study shows that the optimization of the hyperparameters can lead to reasonably accurate performance of all models (root mean squared errors of groundwater predictions of 2 meters or less), but the ''simplest'' network, namely a multilayer perceptron (MLP) performs overall better for learning and predicting groundwater data than the more advanced long short-term memory or convolutional neural networks in terms of prediction accuracy and time-to-solution, making the MLP a suitable candidate for groundwater prediction.\", 'category': 'science', 'relevancy_score': 1.0, 'full_content_fetched': True}, {'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14071v1', 'title': 'A groundwater market model', 'content': 'We introduce the problem of groundwater trading, capturing the emergent groundwater market setups among stakeholders in a given groundwater basin.

The objective of this study is to a) describe the SGMA in California, b) describe a method for estimating a water budget, and c) present the implementation of this method for the Ukiah Valley Groundwater Basin (UVGB). An estimated water budget, done on a monthly time step from 1991 to 2015, was developed in order to characterize the UVGB. Results suggest that the groundwater basin is not in overdraft, and that a portion of the Russian River is a gaining river (approximately 18,952 AF/y) from November to June, and a losing river (approximately 393 AF/y) from July to October. Furthermore, lateral groundwater movement is identified through the groundwater mass balance. Based on previous work and the results of this study, the observed later groundwater losses signify connectivity between the UVGB and the Sanel Valley Groundwater Basin (SVGB). Local groundwater managers and users can use this information to inform proposed action plans and monitoring protocols that will allow them to achieve and maintain groundwater sustainability in the UVGB by the year 2040.', 'category': 'science', 'relevancy_score': 1.0, 'full_content_fetched': True}, {'url': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00477-022-02353-5', 'title': 'Application of hybrid conceptual-statistical model to ...', 'content': 'by H Kazemi · 2023 · Cited by 2 — Our current study aims to investigate the importance of groundwater dependent evapotranspiration on streamflow by using several conceptual models.', 'category': 'general', 'relevancy_score': 1.0, 'full_content_fetched': True}, {'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-022-02353-5', 'title': 'Application of hybrid conceptual-statistical model to estimate streamflow with consideration of groundwater variation', 'content': 'Conceptual models are common and efficient approaches to study short term and long term streamflow change in catchments. However, the possible role of groundwater dependent evapotranspiration on streamflow is not investigated well in literature. To fill this gap, our current study aims to investigate the importance of groundwater dependent evapotranspiration on streamflow by using several conceptual models (i.e., the ABCD type and the Budyko-type models) together with spatiotemporal groundwater level data. The performances of these models in streamflow estimation were assessed in the Harvey River Catchment of Western Australia. The results showed that monthly streamflow estimation was significantly improved, indicating the importance of groundwater level in short time scale. Yet, due to simplification and assumptions necessary for the conceptual models, these models were not able to accurately estimate peak-flow and base-flow variations in the study area. Hence, we further combine the conceptual models with a statistical module to form a hybrid conceptual-statistical framework. The result showed clear increase in the accuracy of the estimation and notable improvement in the models’ performances, affirming that using only conceptual models may not be able to grasp all the aspects required for accurate streamflow estimation.

Based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow model, we tested multiple versions of a flexible procedure we call data integration (DI) to leverage recent discharge measurements to improve forecasts. DI accepts lagged inputs either directly or through a convolutional neural network (CNN) unit. DI ubiquitously elevated streamflow forecast performance to unseen levels, reaching a record continental-scale median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient value of 0.86. Integrating moving-average discharge, discharge from the last few days, or even average discharge from the previous calendar month could all improve daily forecasts. Directly using lagged observations as inputs was comparable in performance to using the CNN unit. Importantly, we obtained valuable insights regarding hydrologic processes impacting LSTM and DI performance. Before applying DI, the base LSTM model worked well in mountainous or snow-dominated regions, but less well in regions with low discharge volumes (due to either low precipitation or high precipitation-energy synchronicity) and large inter-annual storage variability. DI was most beneficial in regions with high flow autocorrelation: it greatly reduced baseflow bias in groundwater-dominated western basins and also improved peak prediction for basins with dynamical surface water storage, such as the Prairie Potholes or Great Lakes regions. However, even DI cannot elevate high-aridity basins with one-day flash peaks.

In this study, an integrated hydrological model (SWAT-MODFLOW) is used to simulate the SW–GW system in the Huashan Basin. The numerical model was calibrated and validated using the streamflow observations of the watershed outlet and the groundwater levels of the long-term monitoring wells from 2016 to 2020 in the study area. The model results show that the SWAT–MODFLOW can achieve a better fit for the streamflow discharge, compared with the results in the single SWAT model, with R2 (coefficient of correlation) and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient) of 0.85 and 0.83, respectively. The water table fitting results indicate that R2 and RMSE can reach 0.95 and 0.88, respectively. The water budgets analysis demonstrates that the average rate (0.5281 m3/s) of GW abstraction to SW is larger than the rate (0.1289 m3/s) of SW recharge to GW. Moreover, the exchange rate of SW and GW gradually reaches a peak value from June to August, and the lowest value is shown in April, for each hydrological year. Based on the IPPC6 CanESM5 dataset supplied by the Canadian Climate Centre, the regional precipitation scenario subject to climate change was predicted by the ASD (Auto Statistical Downscaling Model) a statistical downscaling method, under the climate scenarios of SSP2_4.5 and SSP5_8.5. The SW–GW interaction pattern was modeled under the future scenarios in the study area. The current (2016–2020) average annual rate of the SW–GW interaction is considered as the base value. Subject to the SSP2_4.5 scenario, the average exchange rate of the SW recharge to GW is 0.1583 m3/s, which is an increase of 22.8%.

The precipitation estimation algorithm, derived from a well‐documented approach, includes a locally calibrated loss function component that significantly improves its performance. For the basin‐scale water budget analysis, the precipitation and streamflow algorithms are calibrated with 2 years of SMAP retrievals in conjunction with observed precipitation and streamflow data and are then applied to SMAP retrievals alone during a third year. While estimation accuracy (as measured by the square of the correlation coefficient, r2, between estimates and observations) varies by basin, the average r2 for the basins is 0.53 for precipitation and 0.22 for streamflow. For the subset of 22 basins that calibrate particularly well, the r2 increases to 0.63 for precipitation and to 0.51 for streamflow. The magnitudes of the estimated variables are also accurate, with sample pairs generally clustered about the 1:1 line. The chief limitation to the estimation involves large biases induced during periods of high rainfall; the accuracy of the estimates (in terms of r2 and root‐mean‐square error) increases significantly when periods of higher rainfall are not considered.

The Ganges river basin, the largest and the most populous river basin in India, remains poorly studied in this regard. We conducted a basin-level analysis of major ions, heavy metals, and stable isotopes of nitrate in the Ganges during the pre-monsoon season to constrain the sources and quantify the inorganic chemical composition of the river during its lean flow. Bedrock weathering, anthropogenic interferences, water contribution through tributaries, and surface water-groundwater interaction were identified as the major driver of metal and ion variability in the river. Heavy metals showed the highest concentrations in the upper section of the river, whereas ionic loads were the most variable in the middle. We find a significant impact of tributaries on the metal and ion concentrations of the Ganges in its lower reaches. Isotopic analysis of dissolved nitrate suggested synthetic fertilizers and industrial wastes as the main sources. We find that the otherwise clean waters of the Ganges can show high ionic/metallic concentrations at isolated stretches (As: up to 36 µg/L), suggesting frequent monitoring in the source region to maintain water quality. Except for water collected from the Yamuna and Kannauj in the middle stretch and the Alaknanda and Rishikesh in the upper stretch, the WQI showed acceptable water quality for the sampled stations. These findings provide an insight into the modifications of dissolved inorganic chemical loads and their sources in different sections of the basin, needed for mitigating site-specific pollution in the river, and a roadmap for evaluating chemical loads in other rivers of the world.', 'category': 'science', 'relevancy_score': 1.0, 'full_content_fetched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81458b34f68d7823e2550220a90d2629dce3ec7e', 'title': 'Basin-scale water-balance dataset (BSWB): an update', 'content': 'Abstract. This paper presents an update of a basin-scale diagnostic dataset of monthly variations in terrestrial water storage for large river basins worldwide (BSWB v2016, doi:10.5905/ethz-1007-82 ). Terrestrial water storage comprises all forms of water storage on land surfaces, and its seasonal and inter-annual variations are mostly determined by soil moisture, groundwater, snow cover, and surface water. The dataset presented is derived using a combined atmospheric and terrestrial water-balance approach with conventional streamflow measurements and reanalysis data of atmospheric moisture flux convergence.

However, consideration of surface-groundwater connectivity is seldom addressed in environmental flow development due to a lack of methodologies that account for groundwater contributions to instream flow. Groundwater-influenced streams have been identified as key refugia for native biota under a rapidly changing climate. These ecosystems are anticipated to be more resistant to climate change because groundwater input buffers the adverse effects of low flows and high temperatures, particularly in the dry season. Less understood, however, is the relative contribution of groundwater inputs to streamflow and how these surface-groundwater water interactions should be accounted for in environmental flow assessments and management actions. In order to assess ecological flow needs in groundwater-influenced streams, we applied the California Environmental Flows Framework (CEFF) in two river systems in California, United States. The Little Shasta River and the lower Cosumnes River are representative of many groundwater-influenced streams throughout the semi-arid western United States. Historically, perennial streamflow once sustained diverse native aquatic species in these ecosystems, but water withdrawals for irrigated agriculture has resulted in periodic stream dewatering. We found CEFF was useful in quantifying ecological flow needs for seasonal components of the flow regime that support ecosystem functionality. In particular, CEFF offered flexibility to incorporate information on the seasonal and spatial dimensions of groundwater influences in the development of ecological flow targets. The focus on ecosystem functions in CEFF, and ability to account for groundwater influences on those functions, creates opportunities for integrated surface-groundwater management strategies that support the recovery and protection of streamflows in groundwater-influenced streams.', 'category': 'science', 'relevancy_score': 1.0, 'full_content_fetched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45819f40979b8ffdcb3a79bbb90dc86099bb7303', 'title': 'Impact of climate variability and streamflow alteration on groundwater contribution to the base flow of the Lower Zab River (Iran and Iraq)', 'content': 'Overall water resources evaluations including groundwater contributions to river flow are critical for assessing climate change and drought impacts on basin hydrological responses.

The Lower Zab River basin in northern Iraq has been selected as a representative case study to demonstrate the new methodology. Three of the most commonly used base flow separation methods were assessed: Eckhardt algorithm, flow duration curve and Chapman filtering algorithm. In addition, the indicators of hydrologic alteration method and the reconnaissance drought index have been applied. The results demonstrated that some of the underground water responds to precipitation events. A noticeable increase in groundwater contribution has been observed during the hydrological years between 1998–2001 and 2006–2008 as a result of a sharp decline in the average precipitation. However, the opposite has been observed during the hydrological year 1987, which impacted negatively on the basin water resources availability. The reservoir release through the dry periods causes the observed variations in base flow index (BFI) values between the pre- and post-river damming time periods.

IGF refers to the naturally occurring groundwater flow beneath a topographic divide, which indicates that baseflow simulated by standard hydrological models may be substantially less than its actual magnitude. Identification and quantification of IGF is so difficult that most hydrological models use convenient simplifications to ignore it, leaving us with minimal knowledge of strategies to quantify it. The Castril River basin (CRB) was chosen to show this problematic and to propose the CMB method to assess the magnitude of the IGF contribution to baseflow. In this headwater area, which has null groundwater exploitation, the CMB method shows that yearly IGF hardly varies and represents about 51% of mean yearly baseflow. Based on this external IGF appraisal, simulated streamflow was corrected to obtain a reduction in the percent bias of the SWAT model, from 52.29 to 22.40. Corrected simulated streamflow was used during the SWAT model calibration and validation phases. The Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient and the logarithmic values of NSE (lnNSE) were used for overall SWAT model performance. For calibration and validation, monthly NSE was 0.77 and 0.80, respectively, whereas daily lnNSE was 0.81 and 0.64, respectively.

Due to highly dynamic hydrological processes in comparison to other less permeable systems, they are particularly susceptible to environmental changes. However, little research directly characterizes the impacts of climate and vegetation cover changes on karst water sources. In this study, we aimed to evaluate individual long-term impacts and impacts of sudden large-scale forest disturbances on changes in groundwater recharge and in spring discharge. The work is based on temporal analysis of forest cover and a comparison of trend analysis of hydro-meteorological parameters. To investigate and evaluate vegetation cover change impacts on groundwater recharge, we used a soil water balance model and compared estimated actual daily values of effective precipitation to its fictional estimation disregarding the vegetation cover change. The applied methodology enabled quantification of the impacts of climate and vegetation cover change on selected karst water sources. The study suggests that the vegetation cover can have a significant impact on the spring recharge. Large-scale disturbances that occurred in a short-term mitigated the effects expected from the trend analysis of hydro-meteorological parameters. In the long-term, in addition to climate changes, the multi-decadal natural vegetation overgrowth significantly contributed to the reduction in the spring’s discharge values, especially in the warm season when water demand is higher.

This book (Shepley et al. 2012), a collection of papers written specifically for this volume, provides not only case studies of individual groundwater modeling efforts, but also an important case study of an overall effort to model a nation’s aquifers. I read this book with great personal interest because I have been involved with a similar modeling program in Texas. (Texas is not a nation, but it used to be!) This collection of papers documents a national program administered by the United Kingdom’s Environment Agency between 1998 and 2009 to develop groundwater flow models of England’s and Wales’ primary bedrock aquifers. While most nonnatives will be aware of the internationally famous Chalk Aquifer, the book also discusses the Permo-Triassic Sandstone Aquifer, the Carboniferous Limestone Aquifer, and the Scottish alluvial aquifers, among others. The editors were closely involved in the national effort; therefore, they were well-positioned to coordinate and deliver a thorough and well-documented product. Broadly, the papers in the book fall into one of three categories: (1) organization and execution of the national modeling effort; (2) descriptions of the modeling efforts; and (3) discussions of conceptual model issues, methodologies, and use of the models. After a foreword by Mary P. Anderson (who also served as a reviewer of the volume), the first five papers focus on the organization and execution of the modeling program, including the history of modeling in the United Kingdom, the background of the national modeling program, the management of the program and its standards, how stakeholders were included in the process, and how final models have been served to stakeholders and others.

This method was applied in two typical karst basins of southwest China, the Wujiang River basin (WRB, ∼87,900 km2, ∼70% karstification) and Xijiang River Basin (XRB, ∼360,000 km2, ∼44% karstification). The 2006–2012 monthly baseflow was first separated from in situ streamflow through multivariate regression analysis. Groundwater recharge was estimated using separated baseflow and GWSC estimated from GRACE data and observation‐based groundwater‐level data. The comparison between GRACE‐ and observation‐based recharge in the larger XRB shows better consistency, while that in the smaller WRB shows larger discrepancies. Considering the associated uncertainty (60–93 mm/yr), the 2006–2012 mean recharge in two basins, ranging 199–225 mm/yr (17%–19% of precipitation) is comparable to bulletin‐reported estimates (∼145 mm/yr). Both the degree of karstification and aquifer water table depth influence recharge and discharge processes in karst areas of southwest China. The more karstic WRB exhibits more rapid infiltration (due to more developed permeable epikarst zone) and higher discharge capability (due to more developed underground drainage systems), particularly during dry periods (2009, 2011, and winter). Baseflow exhibits a shorter time lag to recharge and GWSC in the XRB than WRB owing to more quick flow, lower storage with more rapid infiltration, and shorter mean groundwater residence time. Observation‐based monthly recharge reflects different rainfall‐infiltration‐runoff processes under different rainfall intensities, particularly in the WRB.', 'category': 'science', 'relevancy_score': 1.0, 'full_content_fetched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64c7b93f5e594ab4f677f3799581014cd939d99b', 'title': 'Water and chemical budgets of gravel pit lakes: Case studies of fluvial gravel pit lakes along the Meuse River (The Netherlands) and coastal gravel pit lakes along the Adriatic Sea (Ravenna, Italy)', 'content': 'Gravel pit lakes form when gravel is excavated from below the water table of a phreatic or shallow confined aquifer. Typically many of these lakes are concentrated along naturally occurring sedimentary gravel deposits in areas where gravel is needed for construction. Most gravel pit lakes are relatively young features: most are less than 50 years old. The subject of this PhD thesis is to determine how gravel pit lakes change the hydrology and hydrochemistry of an aquifer, a watershed or a drainage basin. Hereto I studied gravel pit lakes in a fluvial freshwater setting of the Meuse Valley (the Netherlands) and gravel pit lakes excavated in ancient beach deposits, filled with brackish water along in the Adriatic coastal zone near Ravenna (Italy). One of the Dutch lakes is used for artificial recharge and drinking water production (DLV Lake) while some other gravel pit lakes are used for recreational purposes (swimming, sailing, scuba diving). The surface water of the lakes and other surface waters (wetlands, rivers) as well as groundwater up and downstream of the lakes was sampled and analyzed for major ion chemistry, trace elements and stable water isotopes. Chemical and water budgets were calculated. The excavation of many gravel pit lakes adds a large surface water area to a watershed. In the Dutch study site 71 lakes between the towns of Maastricht and Asselt add 20 km2 of surface water which is 0.26 % percent of the Dutch part of the Meuse watershed. In the Italian drainage basin thirteen lakes with a total surface of 684 hectares cover 6.6% % of the drainage basin. This increase causes a loss of freshwater since surface water evaporation rates in temperate and Mediterranean climates are usually higher than evapotranspiration rates of the pre-existing grassland and forest. The drainage pattern of a watershed changes in presence of gravel pit lakes causing fluctuations of the water table over a large area. In a low lying coastal zone, as the Italian study area, these fluctuations and the fact that the lakes form a constant head surface below sea level enhance salt water intrusion into the aquifer. Gravel pit lakes can be flow-through lakes where groundwater moves through the lake downstream towards a river or other draining feature (for instance a well field) or, alternatively, they may be in direct connection with a river. The gravel pit lakes that I studied in detail have in common that the water budget of the lakes is strongly determined by artificial drainage. In the Dutch DLV Lake, the artificial drainage is caused by pumping wells that extract water for drinking water production downstream of the lake. In the Italian case, the artificial drainage is induced by the land reclamation works that protect the low-lying land from flooding. Watersheds with multiple gravel pit lakes are more sensitive to changes in climate than watersheds without gravel pit lakes because surface water evaporation rates are more sensitive to changes in climate than evapotranspiration. Especially in groundwater fed gravel pit lakes, evaporated water is replaced by groundwater. Instead evapotranspiration of soil moisture in a watershed without gravel pit lakes, can increase only to certain extend as soil moisture is only fed by precipitation and not by groundwater flow. Water budget and conservative tracer modeling showed that because artificial drainage plays such a large role that changes in pumping rates needed to prevent flooding due to higher sea levels (The Italian study site) will affect evapo-concentration more than changes in surface water evaporation caused by climate change. Precipitation on the Italian gravel pit lakes is immediately mixed with brackish gravel pit lake water and can no longer recharge the fresh-brackish rainwater lenses in the upper part of the aquifer. Both the Dutch and the Italian gravel pit lake water has a high alkalinity, a high pH, and metal and trace element concentrations that differ from the groundwater in their respective watersheds. Differences do exist among the specific trace element concentrations, and their budgets in the lakes and the respective watersheds. This stems from the influence of sea water in the Italian case study and the specific soil chemistry of both settings. As and Ba, for example, show up in high concentrations in groundwater and gravel pit lake water in Italy but not in the Netherlands, where Ni, Zn and Al are more important. Differences in chemistry (Fe, SO4, HCO3, Ni etc. and pH) between gravel pit lake water and groundwater and variations along flow lines show that redox reactions in the soil near the gravel pit lakes occurred in both study sites. These reactions, enhanced by fluctuating water tables and/or denitrification of fertilized soils, have mobilized metals including Fe, Zn, and Ni and other elements such as Al and As. In part, these elements have been adsorbed again by the soil, as is the case for As in the Dutch site, in part they reach the gravel pit lakes where they precipitate on the lake bottom (for example, Fe, Zn, Ni, Al) and some elements remain (partly) in solution in the gravel pit lake water (e.g. As in the Italian lakes). The gravel pit lakes are strongly influenced by the land use and climate of their watershed. If circumstances change that would lead to less available oxygen either as DO or in NO3 or that would lead to a lower pH of the lake water, then the reactions that initially caused the deposition of the metals and trace elements on the lake bottom may be reversed. Metals and trace elements could go again into solution, possibly creating a toxic environment for plants, animals, and humans. These changes may be brought about by a change in land use, for example a reduction in the use of fertilizers, or a change in climate (less recharge of the aquifer), or slow leaching processes such as decalcification of the soil. On the other hand, an increasing eutrophication and primary production stimulated by high temperatures or less lake water circulation, would cause an increase in organic and fine grained material deposition to the lake bottom, which would help to fix the metals and trace elements in the lake bottom sediments. The rate of these processes may change over time since gravel pit lakes have formed only recently while land use and climate change play a role in their current and future evolution. The fixation of metals, C, nutrients and other elements in gravel pit lakes changes also the hydrochemistry of the estuary downstream of the lakes by preventing discharge of dissolved chemical elements into rivers and the sea. In order to assess and evaluate a watershed with gravel pit lakes for its safe use, it is necessary to monitor not only the lake water but also the groundwater, the water budget and the evolution of hydrochemical processes as climate and land use change.', 'category': 'science', 'relevancy_score': 1.0, 'full_content_fetched': True}, {'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2787f60b9e313bb2e485502315f14cac7eaffdfc', 'title': 'Assessment of Groundwater Quality Using the Pollution Index of Groundwater (PIG), Nitrate Pollution Index (NPI), Water Quality Index (WQI), Multivariate Statistical Analysis (MSA), and GIS Approaches: A Case Study of the Mnasra Region, Gharb Plain, Morocco', 'content': 'Groundwater, an invaluable resource crucial for irrigation and drinking purposes, significantly impacts human health and societal advancement.

      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Understanding the dynamics of water budgets at the basin scale is crucial for effective water resource management. Groundwater plays a significant role in maintaining streamflow, especially during dry periods, acting as a stable source of water. This report synthesizes research findings on the role of groundwater in basin-scale water budgets, focusing on methodologies, case studies, statistical models, and conflicting viewpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methodologies for Assessing Groundwater's Contribution to Streamflow\n",
      "Several methodologies have been developed to quantify groundwater's contribution to streamflow. These include:\n",
      "- **Groundwater-Centric Methods**: These methods focus on direct measurements and modeling of groundwater flow and its interaction with surface water. For instance, the study by Mohan et al. (2023) presents methods for estimating groundwater contributions using environmental flow metrics.\n",
      "- **Integrated Hydrological Models**: Models like SWAT-MODFLOW are used to simulate surface water-groundwater interactions, providing insights into the dynamics of water exchange in basins (Zhang et al., 2022).\n",
      "- **Stable Isotope Analysis**: This method helps in understanding the proportion of streamflow derived from groundwater by analyzing isotopic signatures (Santarosa et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Case Studies Illustrating Groundwater's Importance\n",
      "- **Ukiah Valley Groundwater Basin, California**: A study under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) demonstrated that a significant portion of streamflow in the basin is sustained by groundwater, highlighting its role in maintaining ecological balance (SGMA Case Study).\n",
      "- **Wüstebach Catchment, Germany**: Groundwater contributes up to 74% of streamflow, emphasizing the critical role of groundwater in maintaining streamflow during dry periods (Trust, 2025).\n",
      "- **Huashan Basin, China**: The SWAT-MODFLOW model showed significant groundwater contributions to streamflow, with seasonal variations impacting the exchange rates (Zhang et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Statistical Models and Quantification\n",
      "- **Hybrid Conceptual-Statistical Models**: These models combine conceptual hydrological models with statistical techniques to improve streamflow predictions by accounting for groundwater variations (Kazemi et al., 2023).\n",
      "- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**: Used for enhancing streamflow forecasts by integrating recent discharge measurements, demonstrating improved accuracy in regions with high groundwater influence (Feng et al., 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conflicting Viewpoints and Evidence\n",
      "While there is consensus on the importance of groundwater in sustaining streamflow, some studies highlight potential overestimations of groundwater contributions due to methodological limitations. For example, the use of simplified models may not capture peak-flow variations accurately, leading to discrepancies in groundwater impact assessments (Kazemi et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Gaps and Areas for Future Research\n",
      "- **Data Limitations**: There is a need for more comprehensive datasets that integrate long-term groundwater and surface water interactions.\n",
      "- **Climate Change Impacts**: Future research should focus on how climate change might alter groundwater contributions to streamflow, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.\n",
      "- **Advanced Modeling Techniques**: Development of more sophisticated models that can accurately simulate complex interactions between groundwater and surface water under varying climatic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "Groundwater is a critical component of basin-scale water budgets, significantly contributing to streamflow across various geographical and climatic contexts. While methodologies and models have advanced, further research is needed to address existing gaps and improve our understanding of groundwater's role in water resource management.\n",

The authors characterize the dynamics associated with streamflow time series data from about seventy-one U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream-gauge stations in the state of Iowa. They employ a novel approach called visibility graph (VG). It uses the concept of mapping time series into complex networks to investigate the time evolutionary behavior of dynamical system. The authors focus on a simple variant of VG algorithm called horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The tracking of dynamics and hence, the predictability of streamflow processes, are carried out by extracting two key pieces of information called characteristic exponent, {\\\\lambda} of degree distribution and global clustering coefficient, GC pertaining to HVG derived network. The authors use these two measures to identify whether streamflow process has its origin in random or chaotic processes. They show that the characterization of streamflow dynamics is sensitive to data attributes. Through a systematic and comprehensive analysis, the authors illustrate that streamflow dynamics characterization is sensitive to the normalization, and the time-scale of streamflow time-series. At daily scale, streamflow at all stations used in the analysis, reveals randomness with strong spatial scale (basin size) dependence. This has implications for predictability of streamflow and floods. The authors demonstrate that dynamics transition through potentially chaotic to randomly correlated process as the averaging time-scale increases. Finally, the temporal trends of {\\\\lambda} and GC are statistically significant at about 40% of the total number of stations analyzed. Attributing this trend to factors such as changing climate or land use requires further research.', 'doi': '10.3389/frwa.2020.00017', 'authors': ['Ganesh R. Ghimire', 'Navid Jadidoleslam', 'Witold F.

From among the different contaminants, the presence of heavy metals like cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), and lead (Pb) proves to have serious dangers when present in huge concentrations in groundwater. Long-term usage of these poisonous components may lead to neurological disorders, kidney failure and different sorts of cancer. To address these issues, this study developed a machine learning-based predictive model to evaluate the Groundwater Quality Index (GWQI) and identify the main contaminants which are affecting the water quality. It has been achieved with the help of a hybrid machine learning model i.e. LCBoost Fusion . The model has undergone several processes like data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning using Differential Evolution (DE) optimization, and evaluation through cross-validation. The LCBoost Fusion model outperforms individual models (CatBoost and LightGBM), by achieving low RMSE (0.6829), MSE (0.5102), MAE (0.3147) and a high R$^2$ score of 0.9809. Feature importance analysis highlights Potassium (K), Fluoride (F) and Total Hardness (TH) as the most influential indicators of groundwater contamination. This research successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning in assessing groundwater quality risks in Odisha. The proposed LCBoost Fusion model offers a reliable and efficient approach for real-time groundwater monitoring and risk mitigation.

However, this trend is not yet reflected in sensitivity analyses aimed at determining the relevant parameters to calibrate, where streamflow has traditionally played a leading role. On the basis of a Pareto optimization approach, we propose a framework to integrate the temporal dynamics of streamflow and evaporation into the sensitivity analysis and calibration stages of the hydrologic modeling exercise, here referred to as Pareto-based sensitivity analysis and multiobjective calibration. The framework is successfully applied to a case study using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model in three catchments located in Spain as representative of the different hydroclimatic conditions within the Iberian Peninsula. Several VIC vegetation parameters were identified as important to the performance estimates for evaporation during sensitivity analysis, and therefore were suitable candidates to improve the model representation of evaporative fluxes. Sensitivities for the streamflow performance, in turn, were mostly driven by the soil and routing parameters, with little contribution from the vegetation parameters. The multiobjective calibration experiments were carried out for the most parsimonious parameterization after a comparative analysis of the performance gains and losses for streamflow and evaporation, and yielded optimal adjustments for both hydrologic variables simultaneously. Results from this study will help to develop a better understanding of the trade-offs resulting from the joint integration of streamflow and evaporation data into modeling frameworks.', 'doi': '10.1029/2022WR033235', 'authors': ['Patricio Yeste', 'Lieke A.

Traditional hydrologic modeling approaches simulate streamflow by establishing connections across multiple physical processes, such as rainfall and runoff. These data, inherently connected both spatially and temporally, possess intrinsic causal relations that can be leveraged for robust and accurate forecasting. Recently, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have been adopted, excelling in various domains, such as urban traffic management, weather forecasting, and pandemic control, and they also promise advances in streamflow management. However, learning causal relationships directly from vast observational data is theoretically and computationally challenging. In this study, we employ a river flow graph as prior knowledge to facilitate the learning of the causal structure and then use the learned causal graph to predict streamflow at targeted sites. The proposed model, Causal Streamflow Forecasting (CSF) is tested in a real-world study in the Brazos River basin in Texas. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms regular spatio-temporal graph neural networks and achieves higher computational efficiency compared to traditional simulation methods.

Protection of water resources requires the control of pollution sources that may deteriorate them. This is a challenging task in multi-stressed catchments. This work presents an approach that combines pesticide occurrence patterns and stable isotope analyses of nitrogen (delta15N-NO3-, delta15N-NH4+), oxygen (delta18O-NO3-), and boron (delta11B) to discriminate the origin of pesticides and nitrogenpollution to tackle this challenge. The approach has been applied to a Mediterranean subcatchment subject to a variety of natural and anthropogenic pressures. Combining the results from both analytical approaches in selected locations of the basin, the urban/industrial activity was identified as the main pressure on the quality of the surface water resources, and to a large extent also on the groundwater resources, although agriculture may play also an important role, mainly in terms of nitrate and ammonium pollution. Total pesticide concentrations in surface waters were one order of magnitude higher than in groundwaters and believed to originate mainly from soil and/or sediments desorption processes and urban and industrial use, as they were mainly associated with treated wastewaters. These findings are supported by the stable isotope results, that pointed to an organic origin of nitrate in surface waters and most groundwater samples. Ammonium pollution observed in some aquifer locations is probably generated by nitrate reduction. Overall, no significant attenuation processes could be inferred for nitrate pollution. The approach presented here exemplifies the investigative monitoring envisioned in the Water Framework Directive.', 'doi': '10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142377', 'authors': ['Cristina Postigo', 'Antoni Ginebreda', 'Maria Vittoria Barbieri', 'Damia Barcelo', 'Jordi Martin', 'Agustina de la Cal', 'Maria Rosa Boleda', 'Neus Otero', 'Raul Carrey', 'Vinyet Sola', 'Enric Queralt', 'Elena Isla', 'Anna Casanovas', 'Gemma Frances', 'Miren Lopez de Alda'], 'journal': 'Science of The Total Environment Volume 755, Part 1, 10 February\\n  2021, 142377', 'tags': ['physics.soc-ph', 'physics.ao-ph'], 'comments': 'Published in Science of the Total Environment', 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01117v1', 'engine': 'arxiv', 'parsed_url': ['http', 'arxiv.org', '/abs/2101.01117v1', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['arxiv'], 'positions': [4], 'score': 0.25, 'category': 'science', 'query': 'Find research papers on basin-scale water budgets, focusing on the role of groundwater as a stable and important source for streamflow.'}, {'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/15/1/122', 'title': 'A Critical Review of Climate Change Impacts on ...', 'content': 'by V Davamani · 2024 · Cited by 48 — .

The relative gain in forecast skill from postprocessor is generally higher at medium-range timescales compared to shorter lead times; high flows compared to low-moderate flows, and warm-season compared to cool ones.
