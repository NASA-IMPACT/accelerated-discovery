This exchange contributes substantially to basal water budgets, which in turn modulate the flow of ice streams. The geometry of these sedimentary basins is known to be complex, and the groundwater therein has been observed to vary in salinity due to historic seawater intrusion. However, little is known about the hydraulic properties of subglacial sedimentary basins, and the factors controlling groundwater exfiltration and infiltration. We develop a mathematical model for two-dimensional groundwater flow beneath a marine-terminating ice stream on geological timescales, taking into account the effect of seawater intrusion. We find that seawater may become \"trapped\" in subglacial sedimentary basins, through cycles of grounding line advance and retreat or through \"pockets\" arising from basin geometry. In addition, we estimate the sedimentary basin permeability which reproduces field observations of groundwater salinity profiles from beneath Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica. Exchange of groundwater with the shallow hydrological system is primarily controlled by basin geometry, with groundwater being exfiltrated where the basin becomes shallower and re-infiltrating where it becomes deeper.

In this study, an integrated hydrological model (SWAT-MODFLOW) is used to simulate the SW‚ÄìGW system in the Huashan Basin. The numerical model was calibrated and validated using the streamflow observations of the watershed outlet and the groundwater levels of the long-term monitoring wells from 2016 to 2020 in the study area. The model results show that the SWAT‚ÄìMODFLOW can achieve a better fit for the streamflow discharge, compared with the results in the single SWAT model, with R2 (coefficient of correlation) and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient) of 0.85 and 0.83, respectively. The water table fitting results indicate that R2 and RMSE can reach 0.95 and 0.88, respectively. The water budgets analysis demonstrates that the average rate (0.5281 m3/s) of GW abstraction to SW is larger than the rate (0.1289 m3/s) of SW recharge to GW. Moreover, the exchange rate of SW and GW gradually reaches a peak value from June to August, and the lowest value is shown in April, for each hydrological year.

The authors characterize the dynamics associated with streamflow time series data from about seventy-one U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream-gauge stations in the state of Iowa. They employ a novel approach called visibility graph (VG). It uses the concept of mapping time series into complex networks to investigate the time evolutionary behavior of dynamical system. The authors focus on a simple variant of VG algorithm called horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The tracking of dynamics and hence, the predictability of streamflow processes, are carried out by extracting two key pieces of information called characteristic exponent, {\\\\lambda} of degree distribution and global clustering coefficient, GC pertaining to HVG derived network. The authors use these two measures to identify whether streamflow process has its origin in random or chaotic processes. They show that the characterization of streamflow dynamics is sensitive to data attributes. Through a systematic and comprehensive analysis, the authors illustrate that streamflow dynamics characterization is sensitive to the normalization, and the time-scale of streamflow time-series. At daily scale, streamflow at all stations used in the analysis, reveals randomness with strong spatial scale (basin size) dependence. This has implications for predictability of streamflow and floods. The authors demonstrate that dynamics transition through potentially chaotic to randomly correlated process as the averaging time-scale increases. Finally, the temporal trends of {\\\\lambda} and GC are statistically significant at about 40% of the total number of stations analyzed.

We had 60 stop sites along the riverbank for groundwater and river water level observations, and chemical measurements (TDS, EC, temp, and pH). Three river water gauge were also analyzed to see the fluctuations. We identified three types of hydrodynamic relationships with fairly low flow gradients: effluent flow at Segmen I (Kranggan - Batuceper) with 0.2-0.25 gradient, perched flow at Segmen II (Batuceper-Kalibaru) with gradient 0.2-0.25, and influent flow at Segmen III (Kalibaru-Tanjungburung) with gradient 0.15-0.20. Such low flow gradient is controlled by the moderate to low morphological slope in the area. The gaining and losing stream model were also supported by the river water fluctuation data. TDS and EC readings increased more than 40$\\\\%$ from upstream to downstream. At some points the both measurements were two times higher than the permissible limits, along with the drops of pH values at those areas.

Many of the studies shed light on conditions on a local scale only, without exploring a regional angle. To provide a broad and historical overview of groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction, a review of research carried out in Denmark was undertaken due to the high density of studies conducted in the country. The extent to which this topic has been investigated is related to Denmark's physiography and climate, the presence of numerous streams and lakes combined with shallow groundwater, and historical, funding, and administrative decisions. Study topics comprise groundwater detection techniques, numerical modeling, and contaminant issues including nutrients, ranging from point studies all the way to studies at national scale. The increase in studies in recent decades corresponds with the need to maintain the good status of groundwater‚Äêdependent ecosystems and protect groundwater resources. This review of three decades of research revealed that problems such as the difference in scales between numerical models and field observations, interdisciplinary research integrating hydrological and biological methods, and the effect of local processes in regional systems remain persistent challenges. Technical progress in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, distributed temperature sensing, and new cost‚Äêeffective methods for detecting groundwater discharge as well as the increasing computing capacity of numerical models emerge as opportunities for dealing with complex natural systems that are subject to modifications in future triggered by climate change.This article is categorized under: Science of Water > Hydrological Processes Science of Water > Water and Environmental Change Water and Life > Nature of Freshwater Ecosystems\", 'engine': 'openairepublications', 'template': 'default.html', 'parsed_url': ['https', 'doi.org', '/10.1002/wat2.1664', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['openairepublications'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0, 'category': 'science', 'publishedDate': None, 'query': 'groundwater surface water interactions'}, {'url': 'https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21707636.v4', 'title': 'Metal emission facilitated by surface water-groundwater interaction in a sandy beach', 'content': 'The data of physicochemical parameters, metal concentration, 222Rn activity in cross-section, well water, river water and seawater .', 'engine': 'openairedatasets', 'template': 'default.html', 'parsed_url': ['https', 'dx.doi.org', '/10.6084/m9.figshare.21707636.v4', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['openairedatasets'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0, 'category': 'science', 'publishedDate': None, 'query': 'groundwater surface water interactions'}, {'template': 'paper.html', 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3503v1', 'title': 'An integrated assessment of the impact of precipitation and groundwater on vegetation growth in arid and semiarid areas', 'publishedDate': '2014-12-11T00:07:20', 'content': 'Increased demand for water resources together with the influence of climate change has degraded water conditions which support vegetation in many parts of the world, especially in arid and semiarid areas.

The integrated framework systematically combines remote sensing technology with water flow modeling in the vadose zone and field data analysis. The vegetation growth is quantitatively evaluated with the remote sensing data by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the simulated plant water uptake rates. The correlations among precipitation, groundwater depth and NDVI are investigated by using Pearson correlation equations. The results provide insights for understanding interactions between precipitation and groundwater and their contributions to vegetation growth. Strong correlations between groundwater depth, plant water uptake and NDVI are found in parts of the study area during a ten-year drought period. The numerical modeling results indicate that there is an increased correlation between the groundwater depth and vegetation growth and that groundwater significantly contributes to sustaining effective soil moisture for vegetation growth during the long drought period.

Snowmelt dominates hydrology in the basin, with much of the streamflow originating as meltwater. Snowmelt either becomes surface runoff or groundwater recharge, but this partitioning is not well constrained. Furthermore, groundwater recharge from snowmelt can discharge back into streams becoming an important component of streamflow. On average, over half of the streamflow in the UCRB is estimated to originate from groundwater discharge to streams, highlighting the importance of baseflow in sustaining surface water. Yet we have not quantified past spatio-temporal variability of baseflow and its contributions to streamflow, nor do we understand variations in streamflow and baseflow sources under shifting hydroclimates. Here we describe the development and application of linked models of baseflow and streamflow to characterize sources and transport pathways of both baseflow and streamflow in the UCRB at a seasonal timestep from 1986-2020, including the lagged delivery of groundwater to streams over longer timescales. Results suggest that baseflow yields are greatest in headwater catchments during spring, and that a majority of baseflow is derived from water that takes over one season to move through the subsurface to streams. We also find that although streamflow and its sources vary seasonally, on average across the basin, about half of streamflow is from baseflow, which is particularly important for sustaining streams outside the snowmelt season and at lower elevations.</jats:p>', 'doi': '10.5194/egusphere-egu25-1541', 'pages': None, 'publisher': 'Copernicus GmbH', 'tags': None, 'type': 'posted-content', 'url': 'https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/EGU25-1541.html', 'volume': None, 'title': 'Quantifying seasonal snow and groundwater contributions to streamflow across the Upper Colorado River Basin, 1986-202', 'journal': None, 'publishedDate': '2025-03-18T01:01:00', 'authors': ['Olivia Miller', 'Matthew Miller', 'Patrick Longley', 'Morgan McDonnell', 'Daniel Wise', 'Noah Schmadel'], 'isbn': [], 'engine': 'crossref', 'parsed_url': ['https', 'meetingorganizer.copernicus.org', '/EGU25/EGU25-1541.html', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['crossref'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0, 'category': 'science', 'pubdate': '2025-03-18 01:01:00', 'query': 'methodologies assessing groundwater contributions streamflow'}, {'template': 'paper.html', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326%2Fad7c68', 'title': 'Sensitivity of surface water and groundwater contributions to streamflow in a tropical glacierized basin under climate change scenarios', 'content': 'While mountain water faces threats posed by climate change, particularly in snow-dominated and glacierized systems, the role of groundwater (GW) in sustaining streamflow in these systems remains elusive. Changing mountain headwaters, marked by reduced snowpacks, retreating glaciers, shifting precipitation patterns, and rising temperatures, pose a crucial question: what is the resilience of streamflow in these mountains, and what role does GW play in this resilience? This is particularly uncertain in tropical high mountains where the seasonality of precipitation and glacier melt govern streamflow generation. A glacio-hydrological model was created using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform to investigate cryosphere-surface water‚ÄìGW interactions in the Quilcayhuanca Basin, in Peru‚Äôs Cordillera Blanca. The model was forced by in-situ meteorological observations and parameterized using numerous data sources and process-based studies in the basin. Model results show that during the dry season, 37% of streamflow is generated from GW discharge, increasing to 56% during the lowest flows. Evapotranspiration is the largest mass flux from the basin at the peak of the dry season. Precipitation, temperature, and glacier change scenarios were used to assess the sensitivity of basin hydrology to climate change and glacier retreat. In a warmer, wetter, and nearly deglaciated future, Quilcayhuanca basin streamflow is expected to decrease by 4%‚Äì19% annually, with a larger volumetric change in overland and vadose zone flow than in GW flow. The range in values is more closely linked to uncertainty in precipitation change than temperature change.

Transit time distributions of different shapes, mean residence times, and contributions are used to represent the hydrogeological conditions in aquifer systems and are typically inferred from measured tracer concentrations by inverse modeling. In this study, a multi-tracer sampling campaign was conducted in the Salalah Plain in Southern Oman including CFCs, SF6, 39Ar, 14C, and 4He. Based on the data of three tracers, a two-component Dispersion Model (DMmix) and a nonparametric model with six age bins were assumed and evaluated using Bayesian statistics. In a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, the maximum likelihood parameter estimates and their uncertainties were determined. Model performance was assessed using Bayes factor and leave-one-out cross-validation. Both models suggest that the groundwater in the Salalah Plain is composed of a very young component below 30 yr and a very old component beyond 1,000 yr, with the nonparametric model performing slightly better than the DMmix model.

However, unsustainable groundwater pumping, exceeding recharge from precipitation, has led to significant groundwater depletion, particularly in intensively irrigated regions like north India, with cascading impacts on streamflow. Groundwater storage losses reduce groundwater discharge to streams, reverse flow directions, or cease discharge entirely, thereby reducing streamflow. Despite its critical implications on water security, ecosystem health, and agricultural sustainability, the relative influence of groundwater pumping and climate variability in driving streamflow variability remains poorly understood. Most previous studies often relied on coarse-resolution models that overlook groundwater-surface water interactions and lateral groundwater flow. To address these limitations, we applied the physically based, integrated land surface-groundwater model ParFlow-CLM at a 5 km resolution from 1970 to 2022 across the Ganga and the Indus basins. This physically based model simulates three-dimensional groundwater flow using the Richards equation and couples it with land surface processes, enabling robust analysis of groundwater-streamflow interactions. We find that streamflow variability in north India is primarily driven by groundwater abstraction for irrigation, modulated by precipitation variability. Excessive pumping has shifted streams from gaining groundwater to losing it, approaching critical environmental flow thresholds. The study underscores that prolonged groundwater pumping has significantly reduced baseflow contributions, which has critical implications for water management in India.</jats:p>', 'doi': '10.5194/egusphere-egu25-14587', 'pages': None, 'publisher': 'Copernicus GmbH', 'tags': None, 'type': 'posted-content', 'url': 'https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/EGU25-14587.html', 'volume': None, 'title': 'Strong Influence of Groundwater Pumping on Streamflow Depletion across North India', 'journal': None, 'publishedDate': '2025-03-18T01:01:00', 'authors': ['Ritaja Roy', 'Vimal Mishra'], 'isbn': [], 'engine': 'crossref', 'parsed_url': ['https', 'meetingorganizer.copernicus.org', '/EGU25/EGU25-14587.html', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['crossref'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0, 'category': 'science', 'pubdate': '2025-03-18 01:01:00', 'query': 'methodologies assessing groundwater contributions streamflow'}, {'template': 'paper.html', 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08949v3', 'title': 'Enhancing streamflow forecast and extracting insights using long-short term memory networks with data integration at continental scales', 'publishedDate': '2019-12-18T23:44:00', 'content': 'Recent observations with varied schedules and types (moving average, snapshot, or regularly spaced) can help to improve streamflow forecasts, but it is challenging to integrate them effectively. Based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow model, we tested multiple versions of a flexible procedure we call data integration (DI) to leverage recent discharge measurements to improve forecasts. DI accepts lagged inputs either directly or through a convolutional neural network (CNN) unit. DI ubiquitously elevated streamflow forecast performance to unseen levels, reaching a record continental-scale median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient value of 0.86. Integrating moving-average discharge, discharge from the last few days, or even average discharge from the previous calendar month could all improve daily forecasts. Directly using lagged observations as inputs was comparable in performance to using the CNN unit. Importantly, we obtained valuable insights regarding hydrologic processes impacting LSTM and DI performance. Before applying DI, the base LSTM model worked well in mountainous or snow-dominated regions, but less well in regions with low discharge volumes (due to either low precipitation or high precipitation-energy synchronicity) and large inter-annual storage variability. DI was most beneficial in regions with high flow autocorrelation: it greatly reduced baseflow bias in groundwater-dominated western basins and also improved peak prediction for basins with dynamical surface water storage, such as the Prairie Potholes or Great Lakes regions. However, even DI cannot elevate high-aridity basins with one-day flash peaks.

A set of streamflow, ground/surface water withdrawal, climatic, and LULC data used in this study was gathered from publicly available data sources and state agencies.

The precipitation estimation algorithm, derived from a well‚Äêdocumented approach, includes a locally calibrated loss function component that significantly improves its performance. For the basin‚Äêscale water budget analysis, the precipitation and streamflow algorithms are calibrated with 2 years of SMAP retrievals in conjunction with observed precipitation and streamflow data and are then applied to SMAP retrievals alone during a third year. While estimation accuracy (as measured by the square of the correlation coefficient, r2, between estimates and observations) varies by basin, the average r2 for the basins is 0.53 for precipitation and 0.22 for streamflow. For the subset of 22 basins that calibrate particularly well, the r2 increases to 0.63 for precipitation and to 0.51 for streamflow. The magnitudes of the estimated variables are also accurate, with sample pairs generally clustered about the 1:1 line. The chief limitation to the estimation involves large biases induced during periods of high rainfall; the accuracy of the estimates (in terms of r2 and root‚Äêmean‚Äêsquare error) increases significantly when periods of higher rainfall are not considered.

Daily time steps and coupling are used, with groundwater discharge rates calculated for each model computational point along the stream. Model results also are averaged by month and by year to determine seasonal and decadal trends in groundwater discharge rates. Results show high spatial variability in groundwater discharge, with several locations showing no groundwater/surface water interaction. Average annual groundwater discharge is 20.5 m3/s, with maximum and minimum rates occurring in September‚ÄìOctober and March‚ÄìApril, respectively. Annual average rates increase by approximately 0.02 m3/s per year over the 34‚Äêyear period, negligible compared with the average annual rate, although 70% of the stream network experiences an increase in groundwater discharge rate between 1970 and 2003.

We analyze the long-term persistence properties of the series by computing the Hurst exponent, not only in its original form but also under an evolutionary point of view by analyzing the Hurst exponents over a rolling windows basis. The methodological tool adopted for the persistence is the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), which is classically known as suitable for our purpose. As an ancillary exploration, we implement a control on the data validity by assessing if the data exhibit the regularity stated by Benford's law. Results are interesting under different viewpoints. First, we show that the Paglia river streamflow exhibits periodicities which broadly suggest the existence of some common behaviour with El Nino and the North Atlantic Oscillations: this specifically points to a (not necessarily direct) effect of these oceanic phenomena on the hydrogeological equilibria of very far geographical zones: however, such an hypothesis needs further analyses to be validated. Second, the series of streamflows shows an antipersistent behaviour. Third, data are not consistent with Benford's law: this suggests that the measurement criteria should be opportunely revised. Fourth, the streamflow distribution is well approximated by a discrete generalized Beta distribution: this is well in accordance with the measured streamflows being the outcome of a complex system.\", 'doi': '10.1016/j.physa.2016.11.137', 'authors': ['Marcel Ausloos', 'Roy Cerqueti', 'Claudio Lupi'], 'journal': 'Physica A 470 (2017) 39-50', 'tags': ['physics.geo-ph', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'stat.AP'], 'comments': 'prepared for Physica A; 23 pages; 42 references; 3 tables; 11 figures', 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09167v1', 'engine': 'arxiv', 'parsed_url': ['http', 'arxiv.org', '/abs/1611.09167v1', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['arxiv'], 'positions': [2], 'score': 0.5, 'category': 'science', 'pubdate': '2016-11-24 11:07:09', 'query': 'methodologies assessing groundwater contributions streamflow'}, {'template': 'paper.html', 'content': '<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ground water occurrence, movement, and its contribution to streamflow were investigated in Loch Vale, an alpine catchment in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains.

We sought to identify the sources of this increased flow using water stable isotope data and an analysis of streamflow responses to rain events. We collected and assessed 402 urban stream, 522 tap, and 38 precipitation samples across 2019, 2021, and 2022. Two endmember mixing analysis was utilized to obtain the percentage of precipitation-derived groundwater and tap water contributing to urban baseflow. Our endmember mixing results revealed that a major portion of stream water came from tap water, through excess lawn irrigation returning to the stream and leaking water pipes. The average portions of streamflow that come from tap water and lawn irrigation return flow were 76% and 47% respectively across 2019, 2021, and 2022. Uncertainty related to estimation of tap contribution and lawn irrigation return flow ranged from 3 ‚Äì 29%. We also observed an increasing correlation between lawn irrigation return flow in urban streams and imperviousness of the watersheds in the Denver area. In semi-arid and arid cities in the USA, including in Denver, urban irrigation consumes a large portion of city water. Through an analysis of spatiotemporal variations in streamflow, we observed that tap water is a larger contributor to urban streamflow than increased stormflow during most months. The joint contributions of tap water and directly-connected impervious area driving increased stormwater lead to profound alterations in the urban streamflow regime compared to grassland streamflow.

When a quarry is deepened the water table of the exploited geological formation might be reached. A dewatering system is therefore installed so that the quarry activities can continue, possibly impacting the nearby water catchments. In order to recommend an adequate feasibility study before deepening a quarry, we propose two interaction indices between extractive activity and groundwater resources based on hazard and vulnerability parameters used in the assessment of natural hazards. The levels of each index (low, medium, high, very high) correspond to the potential impact of the quarry on the regional hydrogeology. The first index is based on a discrete choice modelling methodology while the second is relying on an artificial neural network. It is shown that these two complementary approaches (the former being probabilistic while the latter fully deterministic) are able to predict accurately the level of interaction. Their use is finally illustrated by their application on the Boverie quarry and the Tridaine gallery located in Belgium. The indices determine the current interaction level as well as the one resulting from future quarry extensions. The results highlight the very high interaction level of the quarry with the gallery.', 'doi': '10.1007/s12665-016-6268-z', 'authors': ['Johan Barth√©lemy', 'Timoteo Carletti', 'Louise Collier', 'Vincent Hallet', 'Marie Moriam√©', 'Annick Sartenaer'], 'journal': 'Environ Earth Sci (2016) 75: 1467', 'tags': ['physics.geo-ph'], 'comments': None, 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08958v1', 'engine': 'arxiv', 'parsed_url': ['http', 'arxiv.org', '/abs/1611.08958v1', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['arxiv'], 'positions': [2], 'score': 0.5, 'category': 'science', 'pubdate': '2016-11-28 02:07:52', 'query': 'methodologies assessing groundwater contributions streamflow'}, {'template': 'paper.html', 'content': '', 'doi': '10.32614/cran.package.streamdepletr', 'pages': None, 'publisher': 'The R Foundation', 'tags': None, 'type': 'dataset', 'url': 'https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=streamDepletr', 'volume': None, 'title': 'streamDepletr: Estimate Streamflow Depletion Due to Groundwater Pumping', 'journal': 'CRAN: Contributed Packages', 'publishedDate': '2019-04-25T01:01:00', 'authors': ['Sam Zipper'], 'isbn': [], 'engine': 'crossref', 'parsed_url': ['https', 'CRAN.R-project.org', '/package=streamDepletr', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['crossref'], 'positions': [2], 'score': 0.5, 'category': 'science', 'pubdate': '2019-04-25 01:01:00', 'query': 'methodologies assessing groundwater contributions streamflow'}, {'template': 'paper.html', 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19865v1', 'title': 'Evaluating Deep Learning Approaches for Predictions in Unmonitored Basins with Continental-scale Stream Temperature Models', 'publishedDate': '2024-10-23T15:36:59', 'content': 'The prediction of streamflows and other environmental variables in unmonitored basins is a grand challenge in hydrology. Recent machine learning (ML) models can harness vast datasets for accurate predictions at large spatial scales. However, there are open questions regarding model design and data needed for inputs and training to improve performance. This study explores these questions while demonstrating the ability of deep learning models to make accurate stream temperature predictions in unmonitored basins across the conterminous United States. First, we compare top-down models that utilize data from a large number of basins with bottom-up methods that transfer ML models built on local sites, reflecting traditional regionalization techniques. We also evaluate an intermediary grouped modeling approach that categorizes sites based on regional co-location or similarity of catchment characteristics. Second, we evaluate trade-offs between model complexity, prediction accuracy, and applicability for more target locations by systematically removing inputs. We then examine model performance when additional training data becomes available due to reductions in input requirements. Our results suggest that top-down models significantly outperform bottom-up and grouped models. Moreover, it is possible to get acceptable accuracy by reducing both dynamic and static inputs enabling predictions for more sites with lower model complexity and computational needs. From detailed error analysis, we determined that the models are more accurate for sites primarily controlled by air temperatures compared to locations impacted by groundwater and dams. By addressing these questions, this research offers a comprehensive perspective on optimizing ML model design for accurate predictions in unmonitored regions.', 'doi': 'None', 'authors': ['Jared D.

We find that the unusual minimum of solar activity in recent years have a correlation on very low levels in the Parana's flow, and we report historical evidence of low water levels during the Little Ice Age. We also study data for the streamflow of three other rivers (Colorado, San Juan and Atuel), and snow levels in the Andes. We obtained that, after eliminating the secular trends and smoothing out the solar cycle, there is a strong positive correlation between the residuals of both the Sunspot Number and the streamflows, as we obtained for the Parana.

Both CC and LULCC contributed almost equally to the deficit, but the surplus was more LULCC-driven. Risk from CC may affect 9.10% of the croplands equivalent to 0.31 million dollars, while both CC and LULCC doubled the croplands at risk (19.13%, 0.60 million dollars) in one cropping season.

An advantage of using the SUR model is that it accounts for cross-hydrological correlation, which is important due to the cross-sectional dependence between streamflow and pumpages. A set of streamflow, ground/surface water withdrawal, climatic, and LULC data used in this study was gathered from publicly available data sources and state agencies. Furthermore, the results show that a 10% increase in corn acreage in the watershed could lead to a significant rise in surface water and groundwater pumpings demands, respectively at 124% and 168%. This study identifies potential evapotranspiration (PET) threshold, which may lead to a water deficit in the region. For various LULC scenarios involving corn and urban area expansion, the probability of facing water scarcity at least once from 2025 to 2060 is estimated to range from 0.2% to 3.8% and 0.7% to 2.6% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively.

Recently, purely data-driven deep learning models like long short-term memory (LSTM) showed seemingly-insurmountable performance in modeling rainfall-runoff and other geoscientific variables, yet they cannot predict untrained physical variables and remain challenging to interpret. Here we show that differentiable, learnable, process-based models (called {\\\\delta} models here) can approach the performance level of LSTM for the intensively-observed variable (streamflow) with regionalized parameterization. We use a simple hydrologic model HBV as the backbone and use embedded neural networks, which can only be trained in a differentiable programming framework, to parameterize, enhance, or replace the process-based model modules. Without using an ensemble or post-processor, {\\\\delta} models can obtain a median Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.732 for 671 basins across the USA for the Daymet forcing dataset, compared to 0.748 from a state-of-the-art LSTM model with the same setup. For another forcing dataset, the difference is even smaller: 0.715 vs. 0.722. Meanwhile, the resulting learnable process-based models can output a full set of untrained variables, e.g., soil and groundwater storage, snowpack, evapotranspiration, and baseflow, and later be constrained by their observations. Both simulated evapotranspiration and fraction of discharge from baseflow agreed decently with alternative estimates. The general framework can work with models with various process complexity and opens up the path for learning physics from big data.', 'doi': '10.1029/2022WR032404', 'authors': ['Dapeng Feng', 'Jiangtao Liu', 'Kathryn Lawson', 'Chaopeng Shen'], 'journal': 'Water Resources Research, 58 (2022)', 'tags': ['cs.LG'], 'comments': None, 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14827v2', 'engine': 'arxiv', 'parsed_url': ['http', 'arxiv.org', '/abs/2203.14827v2', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['arxiv'], 'positions': [3], 'score': 0.3333333333333333, 'category': 'science', 'pubdate': '2022-03-28 15:06:53', 'query': 'basin-scale water budgets groundwater streamflow'}, {'template': 'paper.html', 'content': '<jats:p>The amount of water taken from groundwater for agricultural irrigation is often not observed, while hydrological models have been extensively proposed to investigate the irrigation dynamics and impacts in agricultural areas. In this work, we propose an agro-hydrological model that integrates agricultural irrigation with the traditional Xin‚Äôanjiang (XAJ) hydrological model. In particular, the proposed model incorporates the FAO guidelines on crop evapotranspiration into hydrological routing of water balance and flow fluxes in unsaturated and saturated zones. The model was used to calibrate the groundwater irrigation amounts in terms of both the observed river discharge and the groundwater depth in the Xuanwu plain area of the Huaihe River Basin in China. The calibration and sensitivity analyses were performed by the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method. This method can be applied to a single-objective optimization of model parameters, based on either the river discharge or the groundwater depth, or to a multi-objective optimization of model parameters based on both of these objectives. The results show that the multi-objective calibration is more efficient than the single-objective method for capturing dynamics of the river discharge and the groundwater depth. The estimated means of the annual groundwater withdrawal for wheat and maize irrigations were found to be about 140.5 mm and 13.7 mm, respectively. The correlation between the groundwater withdrawal and the change in groundwater depth during crop growing seasons demonstrated that the groundwater withdrawal is the dominant factor for the groundwater depth change in the river basin, particularly in the winter wheat season. Moreover, model simulations show that the combined effects of the reduced precipitation and the increased groundwater withdrawal would lead to a decrease of the average annual runoff and an increase of the average groundwater depth. These estimates can greatly help in understanding the irregular changes in the groundwater withdrawal and offer a quantitative basis for studying future groundwater demands in this area.</jats:p>', 'doi': '10.3390/w13162220', 'pages': '2220', 'publisher': 'MDPI AG', 'tags': None, 'type': 'journal-article', 'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/16/2220', 'volume': '13', 'title': 'Modeling Groundwater-Fed Irrigation and Its Impact on Streamflow and Groundwater Depth in an Agricultural Area of Huaihe River Basin, China', 'journal': 'Water', 'publishedDate': '2021-08-15T01:01:00', 'authors': ['Yimeng Sun', 'Xi Chen', 'Xi Chen', 'Liu Yang'], 'isbn': [], 'engine': 'crossref', 'parsed_url': ['https', 'www.mdpi.com', '/2073-4441/13/16/2220', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['crossref'], 'positions': [3], 'score': 0.3333333333333333, 'category': 'science', 'pubdate': '2021-08-15 01:01:00', 'query': 'basin-scale water budgets groundwater streamflow'}, {'template': 'paper.html', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2024.2378100', 'title': 'Evaluating surface and subsurface fluxes in hydrological models to advance basin-scale operational water supply forecasting', 'content': 'ABSTRACT Comprehensive assessments of hydrological components are crucial for enhancing operational water supply simulations.

To address this, we propose Hierarchical Conditional Multi-Task Learning (HCMTL), a hierarchical approach that jointly models soil water and snowpack processes based on their causal connections to streamflow. HCMTL utilizes task embeddings to connect network modules, enhancing flexibility and expressiveness while capturing unobserved processes beyond soil water and snowpack. It also incorporates the Conditional Mini-Batch strategy to improve long time series modeling. We compare HCMTL with five baselines on a global dataset. HCMTL's superior performance across hundreds of drainage basins over extended periods shows that integrating domain-specific causal knowledge into deep learning enhances both prediction accuracy and interpretability.

This problem is especially acute for integrated groundwater models which are implicitly coupled to another model, such as surface water models, and resolve both multiple scales of flow and temporal interaction terms, giving rise to linear systems with variable scaling. This article uses the theory of 'forward error bound estimation' to show how rescaling the linear system affects the correspondence between the residual error in the preconditioned linear system and the solution error. Using examples of linear systems from models developed using the USGS GSFLOW package and the California State Department of Water Resources' Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM), we observe that this error bound guides the choice of a practical measure for controlling the error in rescaled linear systems. It is found that forward error can be controlled in preconditioned GMRES by rescaling the linear system and normalizing the stopping tolerance. We implemented a preconditioned GMRES algorithm and benchmarked it against the Successive-Over-Relaxation (SOR) method. Improved error control reduces redundant iterations in the GMRES algorithm and results in overall simulation speedups as large as 7.7x. This research is expected to broadly impact groundwater modelers through the demonstration of a practical approach for setting the residual tolerance in line with the solution error tolerance.\", 'doi': 'None', 'authors': ['Matthew Dixon', 'Zhaojun Bai', 'Charles Brush', 'Francis Chung', 'Emin Dogrul', 'Tariq Kadir'], 'journal': None, 'tags': ['math.NA', '65F10, 65N15, 65Z05'], 'comments': '13 pages and 1 figure', 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.4386v1', 'engine': 'arxiv', 'parsed_url': ['http', 'arxiv.org', '/abs/1004.4386v1', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['arxiv'], 'positions': [3], 'score': 0.3333333333333333, 'category': 'science', 'pubdate': '2010-04-25 22:25:25', 'query': 'groundwater surface water interactions'}]\u001b[0m\n",

The geometry of these sedimentary basins is known to be complex, and the groundwater therein has been observed to vary in salinity due to historic seawater intrusion. However, little is known about the hydraulic properties of subglacial sedimentary basins, and the factors controlling groundwater exfiltration and infiltration. We develop a mathematical model for two-dimensional groundwater flow beneath a marine-terminating ice stream on geological timescales, taking into account the effect of seawater intrusion. We find that seawater may become \"trapped\" in subglacial sedimentary basins, through cycles of grounding line advance and retreat or through \"pockets\" arising from basin geometry. In addition, we estimate the sedimentary basin permeability which reproduces field observations of groundwater salinity profiles from beneath Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica.

In this study, an integrated hydrological model (SWAT-MODFLOW) is used to simulate the SW‚ÄìGW system in the Huashan Basin. The numerical model was calibrated and validated using the streamflow observations of the watershed outlet and the groundwater levels of the long-term monitoring wells from 2016 to 2020 in the study area. The model results show that the SWAT‚ÄìMODFLOW can achieve a better fit for the streamflow discharge, compared with the results in the single SWAT model, with R2 (coefficient of correlation) and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient) of 0.85 and 0.83, respectively. The water table fitting results indicate that R2 and RMSE can reach 0.95 and 0.88, respectively. The water budgets analysis demonstrates that the average rate (0.5281 m3/s) of GW abstraction to SW is larger than the rate (0.1289 m3/s) of SW recharge to GW. Moreover, the exchange rate of SW and GW gradually reaches a peak value from June to August, and the lowest value is shown in April, for each hydrological year.

The SW‚ÄìGW interaction pattern was modeled under the future scenarios in the study area. The current (2016‚Äì2020) average annual rate of the SW‚ÄìGW interaction is considered as the base value. Subject to the SSP2_4.5 scenario, the average exchange rate of the SW recharge to GW is 0.1583 m3/s, which is an increase of 22.8%.

The authors characterize the dynamics associated with streamflow time series data from about seventy-one U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream-gauge stations in the state of Iowa. They employ a novel approach called visibility graph (VG). It uses the concept of mapping time series into complex networks to investigate the time evolutionary behavior of dynamical system. The authors focus on a simple variant of VG algorithm called horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The tracking of dynamics and hence, the predictability of streamflow processes, are carried out by extracting two key pieces of information called characteristic exponent, {\\\\lambda} of degree distribution and global clustering coefficient, GC pertaining to HVG derived network. The authors use these two measures to identify whether streamflow process has its origin in random or chaotic processes. They show that the characterization of streamflow dynamics is sensitive to data attributes. Through a systematic and comprehensive analysis, the authors illustrate that streamflow dynamics characterization is sensitive to the normalization, and the time-scale of streamflow time-series. At daily scale, streamflow at all stations used in the analysis, reveals randomness with strong spatial scale (basin size) dependence. This has implications for predictability of streamflow and floods. The authors demonstrate that dynamics transition through potentially chaotic to randomly correlated process as the averaging time-scale increases. Finally, the temporal trends of {\\\\lambda} and GC are statistically significant at about 40% of the total number of stations analyzed.

We had 60 stop sites along the riverbank for groundwater and river water level observations, and chemical measurements (TDS, EC, temp, and pH). Three river water gauge were also analyzed to see the fluctuations. We identified three types of hydrodynamic relationships with fairly low flow gradients: effluent flow at Segmen I (Kranggan - Batuceper) with 0.2-0.25 gradient, perched flow at Segmen II (Batuceper-Kalibaru) with gradient 0.2-0.25, and influent flow at Segmen III (Kalibaru-Tanjungburung) with gradient 0.15-0.20. Such low flow gradient is controlled by the moderate to low morphological slope in the area. The gaining and losing stream model were also supported by the river water fluctuation data. TDS and EC readings increased more than 40$\\\\%$ from upstream to downstream. At some points the both measurements were two times higher than the permissible limits, along with the drops of pH values at those areas.

Many of the studies shed light on conditions on a local scale only, without exploring a regional angle. To provide a broad and historical overview of groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction, a review of research carried out in Denmark was undertaken due to the high density of studies conducted in the country. The extent to which this topic has been investigated is related to Denmark's physiography and climate, the presence of numerous streams and lakes combined with shallow groundwater, and historical, funding, and administrative decisions. Study topics comprise groundwater detection techniques, numerical modeling, and contaminant issues including nutrients, ranging from point studies all the way to studies at national scale. The increase in studies in recent decades corresponds with the need to maintain the good status of groundwater‚Äêdependent ecosystems and protect groundwater resources. This review of three decades of research revealed that problems such as the difference in scales between numerical models and field observations, interdisciplinary research integrating hydrological and biological methods, and the effect of local processes in regional systems remain persistent challenges. Technical progress in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, distributed temperature sensing, and new cost‚Äêeffective methods for detecting groundwater discharge as well as the increasing computing capacity of numerical models emerge as opportunities for dealing with complex natural systems that are subject to modifications in future triggered by climate change.This article is categorized under: Science of Water > Hydrological Processes Science of Water > Water and Environmental Change Water and Life > Nature of Freshwater Ecosystems\", category='science', doi=None, published_date=None, engine='openairepublications', tags=None, authors=None, score=None, extra={'template': 'default.html', 'parsed_url': ['https', 'doi.org', '/10.1002/wat2.1664', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['openairepublications'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0}, should_fetch_full_content=False, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={}, title_augmented='Groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction in Denmark', relevancy_score=None), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21707636.v4'), title='Metal emission facilitated by surface water-groundwater interaction in a sandy beach', query='groundwater surface water interactions', pdf_url=None, content='The data of physicochemical parameters, metal concentration, 222Rn activity in cross-section, well water, river water and seawater .', category='science', doi=None, published_date=None, engine='openairedatasets', tags=None, authors=None, score=None, extra={'template': 'default.html', 'parsed_url': ['https', 'dx.doi.org', '/10.6084/m9.figshare.21707636.v4', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['openairedatasets'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0}, should_fetch_full_content=False, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={}, title_augmented='Metal emission facilitated by surface water-groundwater interaction in a sandy beach', relevancy_score=None), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3503v1'), title='An integrated assessment of the impact of precipitation and groundwater on vegetation growth in arid and semiarid areas', query='methodologies assessing groundwater contributions streamflow', pdf_url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3503v1'), content='Increased demand for water resources together with the influence of climate change has degraded water conditions which support vegetation in many parts of the world, especially in arid and semiarid areas.

The integrated framework systematically combines remote sensing technology with water flow modeling in the vadose zone and field data analysis. The vegetation growth is quantitatively evaluated with the remote sensing data by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the simulated plant water uptake rates. The correlations among precipitation, groundwater depth and NDVI are investigated by using Pearson correlation equations.

Strong correlations between groundwater depth, plant water uptake and NDVI are found in parts of the study area during a ten-year drought period. The numerical modeling results indicate that there is an increased correlation between the groundwater depth and vegetation growth and that groundwater significantly contributes to sustaining effective soil moisture for vegetation growth during the long drought period.

Snowmelt dominates hydrology in the basin, with much of the streamflow originating as meltwater. Snowmelt either becomes surface runoff or groundwater recharge, but this partitioning is not well constrained. Furthermore, groundwater recharge from snowmelt can discharge back into streams becoming an important component of streamflow. On average, over half of the streamflow in the UCRB is estimated to originate from groundwater discharge to streams, highlighting the importance of baseflow in sustaining surface water. Yet we have not quantified past spatio-temporal variability of baseflow and its contributions to streamflow, nor do we understand variations in streamflow and baseflow sources under shifting hydroclimates. Here we describe the development and application of linked models of baseflow and streamflow to characterize sources and transport pathways of both baseflow and streamflow in the UCRB at a seasonal timestep from 1986-2020, including the lagged delivery of groundwater to streams over longer timescales. Results suggest that baseflow yields are greatest in headwater catchments during spring, and that a majority of baseflow is derived from water that takes over one season to move through the subsurface to streams. We also find that although streamflow and its sources vary seasonally, on average across the basin, about half of streamflow is from baseflow, which is particularly important for sustaining streams outside the snowmelt season and at lower elevations.</jats:p>', category='science', doi='10.5194/egusphere-egu25-1541', published_date='2025-03-18T01:01:00', engine='crossref', tags=None, authors=None, score=None, extra={'template': 'paper.html', 'pages': None, 'publisher': 'Copernicus GmbH', 'type': 'posted-content', 'volume': None, 'journal': None, 'authors': ['Olivia Miller', 'Matthew Miller', 'Patrick Longley', 'Morgan McDonnell', 'Daniel Wise', 'Noah Schmadel'], 'isbn': [], 'parsed_url': ['https', 'meetingorganizer.copernicus.org', '/EGU25/EGU25-1541.html', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['crossref'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0, 'pubdate': '2025-03-18 01:01:00'}, should_fetch_full_content=False, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={}, title_augmented='Quantifying seasonal snow and groundwater contributions to streamflow across the Upper Colorado River Basin, 1986-202 - (Published 2025-03-18T01:01:00)', relevancy_score=None), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326%2Fad7c68'), title='Sensitivity of surface water and groundwater contributions to streamflow in a tropical glacierized basin under climate change scenarios', query='methodologies assessing groundwater contributions streamflow', pdf_url=None, content='While mountain water faces threats posed by climate change, particularly in snow-dominated and glacierized systems, the role of groundwater (GW) in sustaining streamflow in these systems remains elusive. Changing mountain headwaters, marked by reduced snowpacks, retreating glaciers, shifting precipitation patterns, and rising temperatures, pose a crucial question: what is the resilience of streamflow in these mountains, and what role does GW play in this resilience? This is particularly uncertain in tropical high mountains where the seasonality of precipitation and glacier melt govern streamflow generation. A glacio-hydrological model was created using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform to investigate cryosphere-surface water‚ÄìGW interactions in the Quilcayhuanca Basin, in Peru‚Äôs Cordillera Blanca. The model was forced by in-situ meteorological observations and parameterized using numerous data sources and process-based studies in the basin. Model results show that during the dry season, 37% of streamflow is generated from GW discharge, increasing to 56% during the lowest flows. Evapotranspiration is the largest mass flux from the basin at the peak of the dry season. Precipitation, temperature, and glacier change scenarios were used to assess the sensitivity of basin hydrology to climate change and glacier retreat. In a warmer, wetter, and nearly deglaciated future, Quilcayhuanca basin streamflow is expected to decrease by 4%‚Äì19% annually, with a larger volumetric change in overland and vadose zone flow than in GW flow. The range in values is more closely linked to uncertainty in precipitation change than temperature change. Despite a strong reduction in snow and ice contribution to streamflow with warming and deglaciation, the concomitant increase in precipitation can limit the changes in streamflow and GW flow, showcasing the resilience of the system to shifts in climate and glacier cover.', category='science', doi='10.1088/1748-9326/ad7c68', published_date='2024-09-18T00:00:00', engine='semantic scholar', tags=['Environmental Science'], authors=None, score=None, extra={'template': 'paper.html', 'journal': 'Environmental Research Letters', 'authors': ['C.

However, unsustainable groundwater pumping, exceeding recharge from precipitation, has led to significant groundwater depletion, particularly in intensively irrigated regions like north India, with cascading impacts on streamflow. Groundwater storage losses reduce groundwater discharge to streams, reverse flow directions, or cease discharge entirely, thereby reducing streamflow. Despite its critical implications on water security, ecosystem health, and agricultural sustainability, the relative influence of groundwater pumping and climate variability in driving streamflow variability remains poorly understood. Most previous studies often relied on coarse-resolution models that overlook groundwater-surface water interactions and lateral groundwater flow. To address these limitations, we applied the physically based, integrated land surface-groundwater model ParFlow-CLM at a 5 km resolution from 1970 to 2022 across the Ganga and the Indus basins. This physically based model simulates three-dimensional groundwater flow using the Richards equation and couples it with land surface processes, enabling robust analysis of groundwater-streamflow interactions. We find that streamflow variability in north India is primarily driven by groundwater abstraction for irrigation, modulated by precipitation variability. Excessive pumping has shifted streams from gaining groundwater to losing it, approaching critical environmental flow thresholds. The study underscores that prolonged groundwater pumping has significantly reduced baseflow contributions, which has critical implications for water management in India.</jats:p>', category='science', doi='10.5194/egusphere-egu25-14587', published_date='2025-03-18T01:01:00', engine='crossref', tags=None, authors=None, score=None, extra={'template': 'paper.html', 'pages': None, 'publisher': 'Copernicus GmbH', 'type': 'posted-content', 'volume': None, 'journal': None, 'authors': ['Ritaja Roy', 'Vimal Mishra'], 'isbn': [], 'parsed_url': ['https', 'meetingorganizer.copernicus.org', '/EGU25/EGU25-14587.html', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['crossref'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0, 'pubdate': '2025-03-18 01:01:00'}, should_fetch_full_content=False, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={}, title_augmented='Strong Influence of Groundwater Pumping on Streamflow Depletion across North India - (Published 2025-03-18T01:01:00)', relevancy_score=None), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08949v3'), title='Enhancing streamflow forecast and extracting insights using long-short term memory networks with data integration at continental scales', query='regional studies groundwater streamflow dynamics', pdf_url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08949v3'), content='Recent observations with varied schedules and types (moving average, snapshot, or regularly spaced) can help to improve streamflow forecasts, but it is challenging to integrate them effectively. Based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow model, we tested multiple versions of a flexible procedure we call data integration (DI) to leverage recent discharge measurements to improve forecasts. DI accepts lagged inputs either directly or through a convolutional neural network (CNN) unit. DI ubiquitously elevated streamflow forecast performance to unseen levels, reaching a record continental-scale median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient value of 0.86. Integrating moving-average discharge, discharge from the last few days, or even average discharge from the previous calendar month could all improve daily forecasts. Directly using lagged observations as inputs was comparable in performance to using the CNN unit. Importantly, we obtained valuable insights regarding hydrologic processes impacting LSTM and DI performance. Before applying DI, the base LSTM model worked well in mountainous or snow-dominated regions, but less well in regions with low discharge volumes (due to either low precipitation or high precipitation-energy synchronicity) and large inter-annual storage variability. DI was most beneficial in regions with high flow autocorrelation: it greatly reduced baseflow bias in groundwater-dominated western basins and also improved peak prediction for basins with dynamical surface water storage, such as the Prairie Potholes or Great Lakes regions. However, even DI cannot elevate high-aridity basins with one-day flash peaks.

A set of streamflow, ground/surface water withdrawal, climatic, and LULC data used in this study was gathered from publicly available data sources and state agencies.

The precipitation estimation algorithm, derived from a well‚Äêdocumented approach, includes a locally calibrated loss function component that significantly improves its performance. For the basin‚Äêscale water budget analysis, the precipitation and streamflow algorithms are calibrated with 2 years of SMAP retrievals in conjunction with observed precipitation and streamflow data and are then applied to SMAP retrievals alone during a third year. While estimation accuracy (as measured by the square of the correlation coefficient, r2, between estimates and observations) varies by basin, the average r2 for the basins is 0.53 for precipitation and 0.22 for streamflow. For the subset of 22 basins that calibrate particularly well, the r2 increases to 0.63 for precipitation and to 0.51 for streamflow. The magnitudes of the estimated variables are also accurate, with sample pairs generally clustered about the 1:1 line. The chief limitation to the estimation involves large biases induced during periods of high rainfall; the accuracy of the estimates (in terms of r2 and root‚Äêmean‚Äêsquare error) increases significantly when periods of higher rainfall are not considered. The potential for transferability is also demonstrated by calibrating the streamflow estimation equation in one basin and then applying the equation in another.

Traditional hydrologic modeling approaches simulate streamflow by establishing connections across multiple physical processes, such as rainfall and runoff.

Recently, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have been adopted, excelling in various domains, such as urban traffic management, weather forecasting, and pandemic control, and they also promise advances in streamflow management. However, learning causal relationships directly from vast observational data is theoretically and computationally challenging.

The proposed model, Causal Streamflow Forecasting (CSF) is tested in a real-world study in the Brazos River basin in Texas. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms regular spatio-temporal graph neural networks and achieves higher computational efficiency compared to traditional simulation methods.

Patterns of groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction are explored throughout the watershed during the 1970‚Äì2003 time period using a coupled SWAT‚ÄêMODFLOW model tested against streamflow, groundwater level and field‚Äêestimated reach‚Äêspecific groundwater discharge rates. Daily time steps and coupling are used, with groundwater discharge rates calculated for each model computational point along the stream. Model results also are averaged by month and by year to determine seasonal and decadal trends in groundwater discharge rates. Results show high spatial variability in groundwater discharge, with several locations showing no groundwater/surface water interaction. Average annual groundwater discharge is 20.5 m3/s, with maximum and minimum rates occurring in September‚ÄìOctober and March‚ÄìApril, respectively. Annual average rates increase by approximately 0.02 m3/s per year over the 34‚Äêyear period, negligible compared with the average annual rate, although 70% of the stream network experiences an increase in groundwater discharge rate between 1970 and 2003. Results can assist with water management, identifying potential locations of heavy nutrient mass loading from the aquifer to streams and ecological assessment and planning focused on locations of high groundwater discharge.

We analyze the long-term persistence properties of the series by computing the Hurst exponent, not only in its original form but also under an evolutionary point of view by analyzing the Hurst exponents over a rolling windows basis. The methodological tool adopted for the persistence is the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), which is classically known as suitable for our purpose. As an ancillary exploration, we implement a control on the data validity by assessing if the data exhibit the regularity stated by Benford's law. Results are interesting under different viewpoints. First, we show that the Paglia river streamflow exhibits periodicities which broadly suggest the existence of some common behaviour with El Nino and the North Atlantic Oscillations: this specifically points to a (not necessarily direct) effect of these oceanic phenomena on the hydrogeological equilibria of very far geographical zones: however, such an hypothesis needs further analyses to be validated. Second, the series of streamflows shows an antipersistent behaviour. Third, data are not consistent with Benford's law: this suggests that the measurement criteria should be opportunely revised. Fourth, the streamflow distribution is well approximated by a discrete generalized Beta distribution: this is well in accordance with the measured streamflows being the outcome of a complex system.\", category='science', doi='10.1016/j.physa.2016.11.137', published_date='2016-11-24T11:07:09', engine='arxiv', tags=['physics.geo-ph', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'stat.AP'], authors=None, score=None, extra={'template': 'paper.html', 'authors': ['Marcel Ausloos', 'Roy Cerqueti', 'Claudio Lupi'], 'journal': 'Physica A 470 (2017) 39-50', 'comments': 'prepared for Physica A; 23 pages; 42 references; 3 tables; 11 figures', 'parsed_url': ['http', 'arxiv.org', '/abs/1611.09167v1', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['arxiv'], 'positions': [2], 'score': 0.5, 'pubdate': '2016-11-24 11:07:09'}, should_fetch_full_content=False, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={}, title_augmented='Long-range properties and data validity for hydrogeological time series: the case of the Paglia river - (Published 2016-11-24T11:07:09)', relevancy_score=None), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2003.tb02436.x'), title='Ground Water Occurrence and Contributions to Streamflow in an Alpine Catchment, Colorado Front Range', query='methodologies assessing groundwater contributions streamflow', pdf_url=None, content='<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ground water occurrence, movement, and its contribution to streamflow were investigated in Loch Vale, an alpine catchment in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains.

We sought to identify the sources of this increased flow using water stable isotope data and an analysis of streamflow responses to rain events. We collected and assessed 402 urban stream, 522 tap, and 38 precipitation samples across 2019, 2021, and 2022. Two endmember mixing analysis was utilized to obtain the percentage of precipitation-derived groundwater and tap water contributing to urban baseflow. Our endmember mixing results revealed that a major portion of stream water came from tap water, through excess lawn irrigation returning to the stream and leaking water pipes. The average portions of streamflow that come from tap water and lawn irrigation return flow were 76% and 47% respectively across 2019, 2021, and 2022. Uncertainty related to estimation of tap contribution and lawn irrigation return flow ranged from 3 ‚Äì 29%. We also observed an increasing correlation between lawn irrigation return flow in urban streams and imperviousness of the watersheds in the Denver area. In semi-arid and arid cities in the USA, including in Denver, urban irrigation consumes a large portion of city water. Through an analysis of spatiotemporal variations in streamflow, we observed that tap water is a larger contributor to urban streamflow than increased stormflow during most months. The joint contributions of tap water and directly-connected impervious area driving increased stormwater lead to profound alterations in the urban streamflow regime compared to grassland streamflow.

When a quarry is deepened the water table of the exploited geological formation might be reached. A dewatering system is therefore installed so that the quarry activities can continue, possibly impacting the nearby water catchments. In order to recommend an adequate feasibility study before deepening a quarry, we propose two interaction indices between extractive activity and groundwater resources based on hazard and vulnerability parameters used in the assessment of natural hazards. The levels of each index (low, medium, high, very high) correspond to the potential impact of the quarry on the regional hydrogeology. The first index is based on a discrete choice modelling methodology while the second is relying on an artificial neural network. It is shown that these two complementary approaches (the former being probabilistic while the latter fully deterministic) are able to predict accurately the level of interaction. Their use is finally illustrated by their application on the Boverie quarry and the Tridaine gallery located in Belgium.

Recent machine learning (ML) models can harness vast datasets for accurate predictions at large spatial scales. However, there are open questions regarding model design and data needed for inputs and training to improve performance. This study explores these questions while demonstrating the ability of deep learning models to make accurate stream temperature predictions in unmonitored basins across the conterminous United States. First, we compare top-down models that utilize data from a large number of basins with bottom-up methods that transfer ML models built on local sites, reflecting traditional regionalization techniques. We also evaluate an intermediary grouped modeling approach that categorizes sites based on regional co-location or similarity of catchment characteristics. Second, we evaluate trade-offs between model complexity, prediction accuracy, and applicability for more target locations by systematically removing inputs. We then examine model performance when additional training data becomes available due to reductions in input requirements. Our results suggest that top-down models significantly outperform bottom-up and grouped models. Moreover, it is possible to get acceptable accuracy by reducing both dynamic and static inputs enabling predictions for more sites with lower model complexity and computational needs. From detailed error analysis, we determined that the models are more accurate for sites primarily controlled by air temperatures compared to locations impacted by groundwater and dams. By addressing these questions, this research offers a comprehensive perspective on optimizing ML model design for accurate predictions in unmonitored regions.', category='science', doi='None', published_date='2024-10-23T15:36:59', engine='arxiv', tags=['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'physics.ao-ph'], authors=None, score=None, extra={'template': 'paper.html', 'authors': ['Jared D.

An advantage of using the SUR model is that it accounts for cross-hydrological correlation, which is important due to the cross-sectional dependence between streamflow and pumpages. A set of streamflow, ground/surface water withdrawal, climatic, and LULC data used in this study was gathered from publicly available data sources and state agencies. Furthermore, the results show that a 10% increase in corn acreage in the watershed could lead to a significant rise in surface water and groundwater pumpings demands, respectively at 124% and 168%. This study identifies potential evapotranspiration (PET) threshold, which may lead to a water deficit in the region. For various LULC scenarios involving corn and urban area expansion, the probability of facing water scarcity at least once from 2025 to 2060 is estimated to range from 0.2% to 3.8% and 0.7% to 2.6% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. These findings underscore the trade-off between water scarcity and food security in the context of changing climate, highlighting a need to design appropriate incentives to enhance water-use efficiency and adopt climate-smart strategies.

Here we show that differentiable, learnable, process-based models (called {\\\\delta} models here) can approach the performance level of LSTM for the intensively-observed variable (streamflow) with regionalized parameterization. We use a simple hydrologic model HBV as the backbone and use embedded neural networks, which can only be trained in a differentiable programming framework, to parameterize, enhance, or replace the process-based model modules. Without using an ensemble or post-processor, {\\\\delta} models can obtain a median Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.732 for 671 basins across the USA for the Daymet forcing dataset, compared to 0.748 from a state-of-the-art LSTM model with the same setup. For another forcing dataset, the difference is even smaller: 0.715 vs. 0.722. Meanwhile, the resulting learnable process-based models can output a full set of untrained variables, e.g., soil and groundwater storage, snowpack, evapotranspiration, and baseflow, and later be constrained by their observations.

In this work, we propose an agro-hydrological model that integrates agricultural irrigation with the traditional Xin‚Äôanjiang (XAJ) hydrological model. In particular, the proposed model incorporates the FAO guidelines on crop evapotranspiration into hydrological routing of water balance and flow fluxes in unsaturated and saturated zones. The model was used to calibrate the groundwater irrigation amounts in terms of both the observed river discharge and the groundwater depth in the Xuanwu plain area of the Huaihe River Basin in China. The calibration and sensitivity analyses were performed by the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method. This method can be applied to a single-objective optimization of model parameters, based on either the river discharge or the groundwater depth, or to a multi-objective optimization of model parameters based on both of these objectives. The results show that the multi-objective calibration is more efficient than the single-objective method for capturing dynamics of the river discharge and the groundwater depth. The estimated means of the annual groundwater withdrawal for wheat and maize irrigations were found to be about 140.5 mm and 13.7 mm, respectively. The correlation between the groundwater withdrawal and the change in groundwater depth during crop growing seasons demonstrated that the groundwater withdrawal is the dominant factor for the groundwater depth change in the river basin, particularly in the winter wheat season. Moreover, model simulations show that the combined effects of the reduced precipitation and the increased groundwater withdrawal would lead to a decrease of the average annual runoff and an increase of the average groundwater depth. These estimates can greatly help in understanding the irregular changes in the groundwater withdrawal and offer a quantitative basis for studying future groundwater demands in this area.</jats:p>', category='science', doi='10.3390/w13162220', published_date='2021-08-15T01:01:00', engine='crossref', tags=None, authors=None, score=None, extra={'template': 'paper.html', 'pages': '2220', 'publisher': 'MDPI AG', 'type': 'journal-article', 'volume': '13', 'journal': 'Water', 'authors': ['Yimeng Sun', 'Xi Chen', 'Xi Chen', 'Liu Yang'], 'isbn': [], 'parsed_url': ['https', 'www.mdpi.com', '/2073-4441/13/16/2220', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['crossref'], 'positions': [3], 'score': 0.3333333333333333, 'pubdate': '2021-08-15 01:01:00'}, should_fetch_full_content=False, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={}, title_augmented='Modeling Groundwater-Fed Irrigation and Its Impact on Streamflow and Groundwater Depth in an Agricultural Area of Huaihe River Basin, China - (Published 2021-08-15T01:01:00)', relevancy_score=None), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('https://doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2024.2378100'), title='Evaluating surface and subsurface fluxes in hydrological models to advance basin-scale operational water supply forecasting', query='basin-scale water budgets groundwater streamflow', pdf_url=None, content='ABSTRACT Comprehensive assessments of hydrological components are crucial for enhancing operational water supply simulations.

To address this, we propose Hierarchical Conditional Multi-Task Learning (HCMTL), a hierarchical approach that jointly models soil water and snowpack processes based on their causal connections to streamflow. HCMTL utilizes task embeddings to connect network modules, enhancing flexibility and expressiveness while capturing unobserved processes beyond soil water and snowpack. It also incorporates the Conditional Mini-Batch strategy to improve long time series modeling. We compare HCMTL with five baselines on a global dataset.

This problem is especially acute for integrated groundwater models which are implicitly coupled to another model, such as surface water models, and resolve both multiple scales of flow and temporal interaction terms, giving rise to linear systems with variable scaling. This article uses the theory of 'forward error bound estimation' to show how rescaling the linear system affects the correspondence between the residual error in the preconditioned linear system and the solution error. Using examples of linear systems from models developed using the USGS GSFLOW package and the California State Department of Water Resources' Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM), we observe that this error bound guides the choice of a practical measure for controlling the error in rescaled linear systems. It is found that forward error can be controlled in preconditioned GMRES by rescaling the linear system and normalizing the stopping tolerance. We implemented a preconditioned GMRES algorithm and benchmarked it against the Successive-Over-Relaxation (SOR) method. Improved error control reduces redundant iterations in the GMRES algorithm and results in overall simulation speedups as large as 7.7x.

Field measurements and numerical modeling were used to investigate the hydrological responses of peatlands and downgradient streamflow as a consequence of disturbance from mining and shifts in climate, individually and in combination. Mine dewatering reduced groundwater storage by as much as 150 mm, equivalent to a water table lowering of 75 cm, thereby decreasing annual streamflow by 66% in impacted tributaries. Although the projected increases to precipitation and evapotranspiration due to climate change were approximately balanced, resulting in minor changes to storage, there were pronounced shifts in the temporal patterns of streamflow, with a diminished snowmelt and spring freshet occurring a month earlier. When considering the cumulative impacts of climate change coupled with mining, a potential shift in peatland ecohydrology toward new equilibria is plausible, implying altered water movement across the landscape and compromised ecosystem function. This study emphasizes the critical need for further monitoring and modeling efforts to characterize the thresholds and mechanisms driving these ecohydrological changes.

This study evaluated the effects of climate perturbations on snowmelt, soil\\nmoisture, and streamflow generation in small Canadian Prairies basins using a modelling approach based on classification of basin biophysical characteristics.

Individual semi-distributed virtual basin (VB) models\\nrepresenting these classes were parameterized in the Cold Regions\\nHydrological Model (CRHM) platform, which includes modules for snowmelt and\\nsublimation, soil freezing and thawing, actual evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture dynamics, groundwater recharge, and depressional storage dynamics including fill and spill runoff generation and variable connected areas. Precipitation (P) and temperature (T) perturbation scenarios covering the range of climate model predictions for the 21st\\xa0century were used to evaluate climate sensitivity of hydrological processes in individual land cover and basin types across the Prairies Ecozone. Results indicated that snow accumulation in wetlands had a greater sensitivity to P and T than that in croplands and grasslands in all basin types. Wetland soil moisture was also more sensitive to T than the cropland and grassland soil moisture. Jointly influenced by land cover distribution and local climate, basin-average snow accumulation was more sensitive to T in the drier and grassland-characterized basins than in the wetter basins dominated by cropland, whilst basin-average soil moisture was most sensitive to T and P perturbations in basins typified by pothole depressions and broad river valleys. Annual streamflow had the greatest sensitivities to T and P in the dry and poorly connected Interior Grasslands (See Fig.\\xa01) basins but the smallest in the wet and well-connected Southern Manitoba basins. The ability of P to compensate for warming-induced reductions in snow accumulation and streamflow was much higher in the wetter and cropland-dominated basins than in the drier and grassland-characterized basins, whilst decreases in cropland soil moisture induced by the maximum expected warming of 6\\u2009‚àòC could be fully offset by a P increase of 11\\u2009% in all basins. These results can be used to (1)\\xa0identify locations which had the largest hydrological sensitivities to changing climate and (2)\\xa0diagnose underlying processes responsible for hydrological responses to expected climate change. Variations of hydrological sensitivity in land cover and basin types suggest that different water management and adaptation methods are needed to address enhanced water stress due to expected climate change in different regions of the Prairies Ecozone.\\n', category='science', doi='10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023', published_date='2023', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['Zhihua He', 'K.

However, the key parameters and processes involved in stream intermittency remain poorly understood. While climatic conditions, geology and land use are well identified, the assessment and modelling of groundwater controls on streamflow intermittence remain a challenge. In this study, we explore new opportunities to calibrate process‚Äêbased 3D groundwater flow models designed to simulate hydrographic network dynamics in groundwater‚Äêfed headwaters. Streamflow measurements and stream network maps are considered together to constrain the effective hydraulic properties of the aquifer in hydrogeological models. The simulations were then validated using visual observations of water presence/absence, provided by a national monitoring network in France (ONDE). We tested the methodology on two pilot unconfined shallow crystalline aquifer catchments, the Canut and Nan√ßon catchments (Brittany, France). We found that both streamflow and stream network expansion/contraction dynamics are required to calibrate models that simultaneously estimate hydraulic conductivity K$$ K $$ and porosity Œ¶$$ \\\\varPhi $$ with low uncertainties. The calibration allowed good prediction of stream intermittency, both in terms of flow and spatial extent. For the two catchments studied, Canut and Nan√ßon, the hydraulic conductivity is close reaching 1.5\\u2009√ó\\u200910‚àí5\\u2009m/s and 4.5\\u2009√ó\\u200910‚àí5\\u2009m/s, respectively. However, they differ more in their storage capacity, with porosity estimated at 0.1% and 2.2%, respectively. Lower storage capacity leads to higher groundwater level fluctuations, shorter aquifer response times, an increase in the proportion of intermittent streams and a reduction in perennial flow. This new modelling framework for predicting headwater streamflow intermittence can be deployed to improve our understanding of groundwater controls in different geomorphological, geological and climatic contexts. It will benefit from advances in remote sensing and crowdsourcing approaches that generate new observational data products with high spatial and temporal resolution.', category='science', doi='10.1002/hyp.15167', published_date='2024', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['Ronan Abherv√©', 'C.

However, few studies have examined the potential impacts of beaver dam analogues on the quantity and timing of streamflow, which is of primary concern for water stakeholders.

The representation of groundwater is simplified in most regional climate models (RCMs), potentially leading to biases in the simulations. This study introduces a unique dataset from the regional Terrestrial Systems Modelling Platform (TSMP) driven by the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model at Low Resolution (MPI-ESM-LR) boundary conditions in the context of dynamical downscaling of global climate models (GCMs) for climate change studies. TSMP explicitly simulates full 3D soil and groundwater dynamics together with overland flow, including complete water and energy cycles from the bedrock to the top of the atmosphere. By comparing the statistics of heat events, i.e., a series of consecutive days with a near-surface temperature exceeding the 90th percentile of the reference period, from TSMP and those from GCM‚ÄìRCM simulations with simplified groundwater dynamics from the COordinated Regional Climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX) for the European domain, we aim to improve the understanding of how groundwater representation affects heat events in Europe. The analysis was carried out using RCM outputs for the summer seasons of 1976‚Äì2005 relative to the reference period of 1961‚Äì1990. While our results show that TSMP simulates heat events consistently with the CORDEX ensemble, there are some systematic differences that we attribute to the more realistic representation of groundwater in TSMP. Compared to the CORDEX ensemble, TSMP simulates fewer hot days (i.e., days with a near-surface temperature exceeding the 90th percentile of the reference period) and lower interannual variability and decadal change in the number of hot days on average over Europe. TSMP systematically simulates fewer heat waves (i.e., heat events lasting 6\\u2009d or more) compared to the CORDEX ensemble; moreover, they are shorter and less intense. The Iberian Peninsula is particularly sensitive with respect to groundwater. Therefore, incorporating an explicit 3D groundwater representation in RCMs may be a key in reducing biases in simulated duration, intensity, and frequency of heat waves in Europe. The results highlight the importance of hydrological processes for the long-term regional climate simulations and provide indications of possible potential implications for climate change projections.\\n', category='science', doi='10.5194/esd-15-167-2024', published_date='2024', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['L.

This study aims to examine how shifts in snowmelt rate (SMR) and snow continuity, an indicator of the consistent existence of snow on the ground, affect snow-driven streamflow dynamics in three alpine watersheds in the U.S. Great Basin. To achieve this end, the coupled hydro-ecological simulation system (CHESS) is used to simulate river flow dynamics, and multiple snow metrics are calculated to quantify the variation of SMR and snow continuity, the latter of which is measured by snow persistence (SP), snow residence time (SRT), and snow season length (SSL). Then, a new approach is proposed to partition streamflow into snow-driven and rain-driven streamflow. The statistical analyses indicate that the three alpine watersheds experienced a downward trend in SP, SRT, SSL, and SMR during the study period of 1990‚Äì2016 due to regional warming. As a result, the decrease in SMR and the decline in snow continuity shifted the occurrence day of 25% and 50% of the snow-driven cumulative discharge, as well as peak discharge, toward an earlier occurrence. Moreover, the magnitudes of snow-driven annual streamflow, summer baseflow, and peak discharge also decreased due to the declined snow continuity and the reduced SMR. Overall, by using multiple snow and flow metrics, and by partitioning streamflow into snow-driven and rain-driven flow via the newly proposed approach, we found that SMR and snow continuity determine the streamflow hydrographs and magnitudes in the three alpine watersheds. Given that warming can significantly affect snow dynamics in alpine watersheds in semiarid to arid regions, this has important implications for water resource management in the snow-dominated region when facing future climate warming.', category='science', doi='10.3390/w14071095', published_date='2022', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['Xiaohua Chen', 'G.

This study evaluates the water security of the Raudhatain and Umm Al Aysh aquifers, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate groundwater recharge rates. Employing high-resolution spatial data, including Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and satellite imagery, the model was calibrated and validated to assess groundwater flows under various land use and climate scenarios. Streamflow generated from combining surface runoff, lateral flow and baseflow estimations, was used to calibrate the model due to the lack of observed streamflow data in the region. The study estimates the average areal groundwater recharge rates for the Raudhatain watershed to be 6.22 mm/year, and the Raudhatain and Umm Al Aysh freshwater aquifers to be 12.35 mm/year and 13.64 mm/year, respectively. These findings prove the reliability of the streamflow estimations, after deep analysis and comparisons of the results with other studies done on the Raudhatain basin. The findings reveal critical imbalances between groundwater recharge and extraction rates, with recharge rates being significantly less than extraction rates. The simulations in this study indicate that without intervention, the current extraction rates will lead to substantial depletion of the Raudhatain and Umm Al Aysh aquifers by the years 2050 and 2059, respectively. The findings of this paper suggest that the amount of artificial recharge required to ensure the long-term safety of the Raudhatain and Umm Al Aysh freshwater aquifers is 3.0 million ùëö 3 and 1.5 million ùëö 3 , respectively, while prioritising the Raudhatain aquifer. This study recommends maximising the utilisation of the sparse rainfall in Kuwait for artificial recharge through sustainable management practices that promote water reuse and recycling. The creation of shallow infiltration ponds in the aquifers known as Chaukas have been proposed to maximise the utilisation of the very little rainfall in Kuwait. By comparing these results with global arid regions, the study provides valuable insights into effective groundwater management strategies that could be adapted to similar environments facing water scarcity.', category='science', doi='10.22271/27078264.2025.v6.i1a.78', published_date='2025', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['Fawaz Ata Bouhamad', 'R.

We created a baseline model and models of CC and LULCC ‚Äúimpact scenarios‚Äù that use: (1) the new climate projections until 2070 and (2) land cover scenarios worsened by forest loss, in a critical watershed in the Philippines. Simulations of peak flows by 26% and low flows by 63% from the baseline model improved after calibrating runoff, soil evaporation, and groundwater parameters. Using the calibrated model, impacts of both CC and LULCC in 2070 were indicated by water deficit (‚àí\\u200918.65%) from May to August and water surplus (12.79%) from November to December. Both CC and LULCC contributed almost equally to the deficit, but the surplus was more LULCC-driven. Risk from CC may affect 9.10% of the croplands equivalent to 0.31 million dollars, while both CC and LULCC doubled the croplands at risk (19.13%, 0.60 million dollars) in one cropping season. The findings warn for the inevitable cropping schedule adjustments in the coming decades, which both apply to irrigated and rainfed crops, and may have implications to crop yields.

This interaction is vital for supporting ecosystems, providing water supplies, and ensuring the sustainable use of water resources. Disruptions in these interactions, such as over-extraction, reduced streamflow, and the impacts of climate change, contribute to water scarcity. An integrated management of surface and groundwater resources is crucial for addressing these challenges and ensuring the long-term availability and sustainability of water supplies. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations of surface and groundwater interactions were analysed using integrated SWAT and MODFLOW model using QSWATMOD plugin in QGIS software. The surface and groundwater interactions were analysed for future periods under climate and land use land cover (LULC) change scenarios. Pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon kharif, and post-monsoon rabi seasons are considered for analysing the surface and groundwater interactions. The future LULCs are projected using the DynaCLUE model for three user-defined scenarios such as past trend (scenario 1), drastic change in built-up and barren land (scenario 2), and restricted agricultural land (scenario 3). For projecting the interactions under both changing climate and LULC, LULC scenario 1 was used for near-future period, LULC scenario 2 for mid-future period, and LULC scenario 3 for far future period. Under the climate change scenario, the maximum groundwater recharge under SSP5-8.5 scenario is observed to be 20,805\\u202fm3/day in the near future, and the maximum discharge under SSP2-4.5 scenario is observed as 9,035\\u202fm3/day in the mid-future period. In both climate change and combined scenarios (both climate and user-defined LULC), there was a greater recharge of groundwater during the monsoon season relative to other seasons, while there was a greater discharge of groundwater during the post-monsoon rabi season. In the combined scenarios, the maximum discharge was under SSP5-8.5 with 15,009\\u202fm3/day in the mid-future, and the groundwater recharge was greater in the near future period under SSP3-7.0 with 19,556\\u202fm3/day. The groundwater‚Äìsurface water interactions were analysed in four seasons, out of which monsoon season had the maximum recharge and groundwater discharge was more in the post-monsoon rabi season.

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool model was used to evaluate the individual and combined impacts of land use/land cover and climate on the hydrology of the Muga watershed. The model was calibrated and validated based on observed streamflow data. The calibrated and validated model demonstrated good performance, as indicated by Nash Sutcliff Efficiency values of 0.79 for calibration and 0.82 for validation. Similarly, the Percentage of Bias values of 8.2% for calibration and 9.3% for validation indicate a small overall bias in the model‚Äôs predictions. According to the findings of this study, there is an overall increase in surface runoff (15.78% in 2022 and 15.28% in 2038) and water yield (1.22% in 2022; 0.83% in 2038), along with a reduction in lateral flow (8.55% in 2022; 7.0% in 2038), groundwater flow (9.21% in 2022; 10.0% in 2028), streamflow (5.8% in 2022; 3.3% in 2038), and evapotranspiration (1.54% in 2022; 0.95% in 2038), compared to the baseline year (1994). The land use/land cover changes in 2022 and projected for 2038 contributed to these alterations in hydrological parameters. The combined effect of land use/land cover and climate change on water balance is relatively higher than the impact of land use/land cover change scenario alone. The intensified rainfall contributes to the observed increase in surface runoff and water yield. Hence, the study is crucial to implementing sustainable land use practices and appropriate watershed management strategies. IMPACT STATEMENT Climate change is a global concern affecting many landscape characteristics. Land use changes as an important variable in soil erosion are expected to change under projecting climatic scenarios. Evaluation of future soil erosion is crucial for devising appropriate interventions. Moreover, research results from such studies contribute to planning, decision-making, and policy development which could make possible sustainability of natural resources.', category='science', doi='10.1080/23311932.2024.2319935', published_date='2024', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['Tatek Belay', 'D.

However, this relationship is rarely explicitly examined because of the complexity of surface to subsurface processes and the diverse impacts of multiple drivers, such as groundwater pumping and land use changes. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing methods to quantify the sensitivity of groundwater level and recharge to temporal climate variability across Australia. Using the HydroSight groundwater hydrograph toolbox we first identify 1,143 out of a total of 4,350 bores as climate‚Äêdriven, where historically, head was primarily driven by climate variations. Streamflow elasticity measures are then adapted to groundwater to quantify the long‚Äêterm head and recharge sensitivity. We find that the national median sensitivity of head and recharge to precipitation change are 42 and 0.43 mm mm‚àí1, respectively (interquartiles: 20‚Äì77 and 0.30‚Äì0.55 mm mm‚àí1); both of which are ‚àº8 times that of potential evapotranspiration. Nationally, the results are spatially correlated, suggestive of large‚Äêscale effects. The responses of head and recharge appear to be primarily related to climate type and hydrogeology. The more arid the climate, the higher the head sensitivity but the lower the recharge sensitivity. Porous media generally show higher head sensitivity than fractured media due to smaller aquifer specific yield, and again contrarily for that of recharge. These findings contribute to understanding the long‚Äêterm impact of climate change on groundwater and thus provide valuable insights for sustainable groundwater management.', category='science', doi='10.1029/2023WR035036', published_date='2023', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['Xinyang Fan', 'T.

The authors characterize the dynamics associated with streamflow time series data from about seventy-one U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream-gauge stations in the state of Iowa. They employ a novel approach called visibility graph (VG). It uses the concept of mapping time series into complex networks to investigate the time evolutionary behavior of dynamical system. The authors focus on a simple variant of VG algorithm called horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The tracking of dynamics and hence, the predictability of streamflow processes, are carried out by extracting two key pieces of information called characteristic exponent, {\\\\lambda} of degree distribution and global clustering coefficient, GC pertaining to HVG derived network. The authors use these two measures to identify whether streamflow process has its origin in random or chaotic processes. They show that the characterization of streamflow dynamics is sensitive to data attributes. Through a systematic and comprehensive analysis, the authors illustrate that streamflow dynamics characterization is sensitive to the normalization, and the time-scale of streamflow time-series. At daily scale, streamflow at all stations used in the analysis, reveals randomness with strong spatial scale (basin size) dependence. This has implications for predictability of streamflow and floods.

Many of the studies shed light on conditions on a local scale only, without exploring a regional angle. To provide a broad and historical overview of groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction, a review of research carried out in Denmark was undertaken due to the high density of studies conducted in the country. The extent to which this topic has been investigated is related to Denmark's physiography and climate, the presence of numerous streams and lakes combined with shallow groundwater, and historical, funding, and administrative decisions. Study topics comprise groundwater detection techniques, numerical modeling, and contaminant issues including nutrients, ranging from point studies all the way to studies at national scale. The increase in studies in recent decades corresponds with the need to maintain the good status of groundwater‚Äêdependent ecosystems and protect groundwater resources. This review of three decades of research revealed that problems such as the difference in scales between numerical models and field observations, interdisciplinary research integrating hydrological and biological methods, and the effect of local processes in regional systems remain persistent challenges. Technical progress in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, distributed temperature sensing, and new cost‚Äêeffective methods for detecting groundwater discharge as well as the increasing computing capacity of numerical models emerge as opportunities for dealing with complex natural systems that are subject to modifications in future triggered by climate change.This article is categorized under: Science of Water > Hydrological Processes Science of Water > Water and Environmental Change Water and Life > Nature of Freshwater Ecosystems\", category='science', doi=None, published_date=None, engine='openairepublications', tags=None, authors=None, score=None, extra={'template': 'default.html', 'parsed_url': ['https', 'doi.org', '/10.1002/wat2.1664', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['openairepublications'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0}, should_fetch_full_content=False, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={}, title_augmented='Groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction in Denmark', relevancy_score=None), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10103v1'), title='Multi-Tracer Groundwater Dating in Southern Oman using Bayesian Modelling', query='methodologies assessing groundwater contributions streamflow', pdf_url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10103v1'), content='In the scope of assessing aquifer systems in areas where freshwater is scarce, estimation of transit times is a vital step to quantify the effect of groundwater abstraction.

In this study, a multi-tracer sampling campaign was conducted in the Salalah Plain in Southern Oman including CFCs, SF6, 39Ar, 14C, and 4He. Based on the data of three tracers, a two-component Dispersion Model (DMmix) and a nonparametric model with six age bins were assumed and evaluated using Bayesian statistics. In a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, the maximum likelihood parameter estimates and their uncertainties were determined. Model performance was assessed using Bayes factor and leave-one-out cross-validation. Both models suggest that the groundwater in the Salalah Plain is composed of a very young component below 30 yr and a very old component beyond 1,000 yr, with the nonparametric model performing slightly better than the DMmix model.

Based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow model, we tested multiple versions of a flexible procedure we call data integration (DI) to leverage recent discharge measurements to improve forecasts. DI accepts lagged inputs either directly or through a convolutional neural network (CNN) unit. DI ubiquitously elevated streamflow forecast performance to unseen levels, reaching a record continental-scale median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient value of 0.86. Integrating moving-average discharge, discharge from the last few days, or even average discharge from the previous calendar month could all improve daily forecasts. Directly using lagged observations as inputs was comparable in performance to using the CNN unit. Importantly, we obtained valuable insights regarding hydrologic processes impacting LSTM and DI performance. Before applying DI, the base LSTM model worked well in mountainous or snow-dominated regions, but less well in regions with low discharge volumes (due to either low precipitation or high precipitation-energy synchronicity) and large inter-annual storage variability. DI was most beneficial in regions with high flow autocorrelation: it greatly reduced baseflow bias in groundwater-dominated western basins and also improved peak prediction for basins with dynamical surface water storage, such as the Prairie Potholes or Great Lakes regions. However, even DI cannot elevate high-aridity basins with one-day flash peaks.

The precipitation estimation algorithm, derived from a well‚Äêdocumented approach, includes a locally calibrated loss function component that significantly improves its performance. For the basin‚Äêscale water budget analysis, the precipitation and streamflow algorithms are calibrated with 2 years of SMAP retrievals in conjunction with observed precipitation and streamflow data and are then applied to SMAP retrievals alone during a third year. While estimation accuracy (as measured by the square of the correlation coefficient, r2, between estimates and observations) varies by basin, the average r2 for the basins is 0.53 for precipitation and 0.22 for streamflow. For the subset of 22 basins that calibrate particularly well, the r2 increases to 0.63 for precipitation and to 0.51 for streamflow. The magnitudes of the estimated variables are also accurate, with sample pairs generally clustered about the 1:1 line. The chief limitation to the estimation involves large biases induced during periods of high rainfall; the accuracy of the estimates (in terms of r2 and root‚Äêmean‚Äêsquare error) increases significantly when periods of higher rainfall are not considered. The potential for transferability is also demonstrated by calibrating the streamflow estimation equation in one basin and then applying the equation in another.

The methodological tool adopted for the persistence is the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), which is classically known as suitable for our purpose. As an ancillary exploration, we implement a control on the data validity by assessing if the data exhibit the regularity stated by Benford's law. Results are interesting under different viewpoints. First, we show that the Paglia river streamflow exhibits periodicities which broadly suggest the existence of some common behaviour with El Nino and the North Atlantic Oscillations: this specifically points to a (not necessarily direct) effect of these oceanic phenomena on the hydrogeological equilibria of very far geographical zones: however, such an hypothesis needs further analyses to be validated. Second, the series of streamflows shows an antipersistent behaviour. Third, data are not consistent with Benford's law: this suggests that the measurement criteria should be opportunely revised.

The levels of each index (low, medium, high, very high) correspond to the potential impact of the quarry on the regional hydrogeology. The first index is based on a discrete choice modelling methodology while the second is relying on an artificial neural network.

Here we show that differentiable, learnable, process-based models (called {\\\\delta} models here) can approach the performance level of LSTM for the intensively-observed variable (streamflow) with regionalized parameterization. We use a simple hydrologic model HBV as the backbone and use embedded neural networks, which can only be trained in a differentiable programming framework, to parameterize, enhance, or replace the process-based model modules.

For another forcing dataset, the difference is even smaller: 0.715 vs. 0.722. Meanwhile, the resulting learnable process-based models can output a full set of untrained variables, e.g., soil and groundwater storage, snowpack, evapotranspiration, and baseflow, and later be constrained by their observations.

These peatlands are threatened by disturbance from large‚Äêscale resource extraction and projected climate change, both of which have the potential to compromise their ecohydrological function. Field measurements and numerical modeling were used to investigate the hydrological responses of peatlands and downgradient streamflow as a consequence of disturbance from mining and shifts in climate, individually and in combination. Mine dewatering reduced groundwater storage by as much as 150 mm, equivalent to a water table lowering of 75 cm, thereby decreasing annual streamflow by 66% in impacted tributaries. Although the projected increases to precipitation and evapotranspiration due to climate change were approximately balanced, resulting in minor changes to storage, there were pronounced shifts in the temporal patterns of streamflow, with a diminished snowmelt and spring freshet occurring a month earlier. When considering the cumulative impacts of climate change coupled with mining, a potential shift in peatland ecohydrology toward new equilibria is plausible, implying altered water movement across the landscape and compromised ecosystem function. This study emphasizes the critical need for further monitoring and modeling efforts to characterize the thresholds and mechanisms driving these ecohydrological changes.

This study evaluated the effects of climate perturbations on snowmelt, soil\\nmoisture, and streamflow generation in small Canadian Prairies basins using a modelling approach based on classification of basin biophysical characteristics. Seven basin classes that encompass the entirety of the\\nPrairies Ecozone in Canada were determined by cluster analysis of these\\ncharacteristics. Individual semi-distributed virtual basin (VB) models\\nrepresenting these classes were parameterized in the Cold Regions\\nHydrological Model (CRHM) platform, which includes modules for snowmelt and\\nsublimation, soil freezing and thawing, actual evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture dynamics, groundwater recharge, and depressional storage dynamics including fill and spill runoff generation and variable connected areas. Precipitation (P) and temperature (T) perturbation scenarios covering the range of climate model predictions for the 21st\\xa0century were used to evaluate climate sensitivity of hydrological processes in individual land cover and basin types across the Prairies Ecozone. Results indicated that snow accumulation in wetlands had a greater sensitivity to P and T than that in croplands and grasslands in all basin types. Wetland soil moisture was also more sensitive to T than the cropland and grassland soil moisture. Jointly influenced by land cover distribution and local climate, basin-average snow accumulation was more sensitive to T in the drier and grassland-characterized basins than in the wetter basins dominated by cropland, whilst basin-average soil moisture was most sensitive to T and P perturbations in basins typified by pothole depressions and broad river valleys. Annual streamflow had the greatest sensitivities to T and P in the dry and poorly connected Interior Grasslands (See Fig.\\xa01) basins but the smallest in the wet and well-connected Southern Manitoba basins. The ability of P to compensate for warming-induced reductions in snow accumulation and streamflow was much higher in the wetter and cropland-dominated basins than in the drier and grassland-characterized basins, whilst decreases in cropland soil moisture induced by the maximum expected warming of 6\\u2009‚àòC could be fully offset by a P increase of 11\\u2009% in all basins. These results can be used to (1)\\xa0identify locations which had the largest hydrological sensitivities to changing climate and (2)\\xa0diagnose underlying processes responsible for hydrological responses to expected climate change. Variations of hydrological sensitivity in land cover and basin types suggest that different water management and adaptation methods are needed to address enhanced water stress due to expected climate change in different regions of the Prairies Ecozone.\\n', category='science', doi='10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023', published_date='2023', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['Zhihua He', 'K.

The representation of groundwater is simplified in most regional climate models (RCMs), potentially leading to biases in the simulations. This study introduces a unique dataset from the regional Terrestrial Systems Modelling Platform (TSMP) driven by the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model at Low Resolution (MPI-ESM-LR) boundary conditions in the context of dynamical downscaling of global climate models (GCMs) for climate change studies. TSMP explicitly simulates full 3D soil and groundwater dynamics together with overland flow, including complete water and energy cycles from the bedrock to the top of the atmosphere. By comparing the statistics of heat events, i.e., a series of consecutive days with a near-surface temperature exceeding the 90th percentile of the reference period, from TSMP and those from GCM‚ÄìRCM simulations with simplified groundwater dynamics from the COordinated Regional Climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX) for the European domain, we aim to improve the understanding of how groundwater representation affects heat events in Europe. The analysis was carried out using RCM outputs for the summer seasons of 1976‚Äì2005 relative to the reference period of 1961‚Äì1990. While our results show that TSMP simulates heat events consistently with the CORDEX ensemble, there are some systematic differences that we attribute to the more realistic representation of groundwater in TSMP. Compared to the CORDEX ensemble, TSMP simulates fewer hot days (i.e., days with a near-surface temperature exceeding the 90th percentile of the reference period) and lower interannual variability and decadal change in the number of hot days on average over Europe. TSMP systematically simulates fewer heat waves (i.e., heat events lasting 6\\u2009d or more) compared to the CORDEX ensemble; moreover, they are shorter and less intense. The Iberian Peninsula is particularly sensitive with respect to groundwater. Therefore, incorporating an explicit 3D groundwater representation in RCMs may be a key in reducing biases in simulated duration, intensity, and frequency of heat waves in Europe. The results highlight the importance of hydrological processes for the long-term regional climate simulations and provide indications of possible potential implications for climate change projections.\\n', category='science', doi='10.5194/esd-15-167-2024', published_date='2024', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['L.

However, this relationship is rarely explicitly examined because of the complexity of surface to subsurface processes and the diverse impacts of multiple drivers, such as groundwater pumping and land use changes. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing methods to quantify the sensitivity of groundwater level and recharge to temporal climate variability across Australia. Using the HydroSight groundwater hydrograph toolbox we first identify 1,143 out of a total of 4,350 bores as climate‚Äêdriven, where historically, head was primarily driven by climate variations. Streamflow elasticity measures are then adapted to groundwater to quantify the long‚Äêterm head and recharge sensitivity. We find that the national median sensitivity of head and recharge to precipitation change are 42 and 0.43 mm mm‚àí1, respectively (interquartiles: 20‚Äì77 and 0.30‚Äì0.55 mm mm‚àí1); both of which are ‚àº8 times that of potential evapotranspiration. Nationally, the results are spatially correlated, suggestive of large‚Äêscale effects. The responses of head and recharge appear to be primarily related to climate type and hydrogeology. The more arid the climate, the higher the head sensitivity but the lower the recharge sensitivity. Porous media generally show higher head sensitivity than fractured media due to smaller aquifer specific yield, and again contrarily for that of recharge. These findings contribute to understanding the long‚Äêterm impact of climate change on groundwater and thus provide valuable insights for sustainable groundwater management.', category='science', doi='10.1029/2023WR035036', published_date='2023', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['Xinyang Fan', 'T.

Many of the studies shed light on conditions on a local scale only, without exploring a regional angle. To provide a broad and historical overview of groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction, a review of research carried out in Denmark was undertaken due to the high density of studies conducted in the country. The extent to which this topic has been investigated is related to Denmark's physiography and climate, the presence of numerous streams and lakes combined with shallow groundwater, and historical, funding, and administrative decisions. Study topics comprise groundwater detection techniques, numerical modeling, and contaminant issues including nutrients, ranging from point studies all the way to studies at national scale. The increase in studies in recent decades corresponds with the need to maintain the good status of groundwater‚Äêdependent ecosystems and protect groundwater resources. This review of three decades of research revealed that problems such as the difference in scales between numerical models and field observations, interdisciplinary research integrating hydrological and biological methods, and the effect of local processes in regional systems remain persistent challenges. Technical progress in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, distributed temperature sensing, and new cost‚Äêeffective methods for detecting groundwater discharge as well as the increasing computing capacity of numerical models emerge as opportunities for dealing with complex natural systems that are subject to modifications in future triggered by climate change.This article is categorized under: Science of Water > Hydrological Processes Science of Water > Water and Environmental Change Water and Life > Nature of Freshwater Ecosystems\", category='science', doi=None, published_date=None, engine='openairepublications', tags=None, authors=None, score=1.0, extra={'template': 'default.html', 'parsed_url': ['https', 'doi.org', '/10.1002/wat2.1664', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['openairepublications'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0}, should_fetch_full_content=True, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={'topic_alignment': <TopicAlignmentLabel.ALIGNED: 'aligned'>, 'content_depth': <ContentDepthLabel.COMPREHENSIVE: 'comprehensive'>, 'recency_relevance': <RecencyRelevanceLabel.CURRENT: 'current'>, 'methodological_relevance': <MethodologicalRelevanceLabel.METHODOLOGICALLY_SOUND: 'methodologically_sound'>, 'evidence_quality': <EvidenceQualityLabel.HIGH_QUALITY_EVIDENCE: 'high_quality_evidence'>, 'scope_relevance': <ScopeRelevanceLabel.IN_SCOPE: 'in_scope'>, 'overall_relevance': <EnhancedRelevancyLabel.HIGHLY_RELEVANT: 'highly_relevant'>, 'reasoning_steps': [\"The topic of groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction is directly related to basin-scale water budgets, particularly in understanding groundwater's role in streamflow.\", 'The content provides a comprehensive review of groundwater studies in Denmark, which includes various scales and methodologies relevant to the query.', 'The research is recent and reflects current trends and challenges in groundwater management and its implications for streamflow.', 'The methodologies discussed, such as numerical modeling and groundwater detection techniques, are sound and relevant to the study of water budgets.', 'The evidence presented in the review is of high quality, as it synthesizes three decades of research and addresses significant challenges in the field.', 'The scope of the article is appropriate as it covers both local and regional aspects of groundwater interaction, which is essential for understanding basin-scale water budgets.']}, title_augmented='Groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction in Denmark', relevancy_score=1.0), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10103v1'), title='Multi-Tracer Groundwater Dating in Southern Oman using Bayesian Modelling', query='methodologies assessing groundwater contributions streamflow', pdf_url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10103v1'), content='In the scope of assessing aquifer systems in areas where freshwater is scarce, estimation of transit times is a vital step to quantify the effect of groundwater abstraction. Transit time distributions of different shapes, mean residence times, and contributions are used to represent the hydrogeological conditions in aquifer systems and are typically inferred from measured tracer concentrations by inverse modeling. In this study, a multi-tracer sampling campaign was conducted in the Salalah Plain in Southern Oman including CFCs, SF6, 39Ar, 14C, and 4He. Based on the data of three tracers, a two-component Dispersion Model (DMmix) and a nonparametric model with six age bins were assumed and evaluated using Bayesian statistics. In a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, the maximum likelihood parameter estimates and their uncertainties were determined. Model performance was assessed using Bayes factor and leave-one-out cross-validation. Both models suggest that the groundwater in the Salalah Plain is composed of a very young component below 30 yr and a very old component beyond 1,000 yr, with the nonparametric model performing slightly better than the DMmix model. All wells except one exhibit reasonable goodness of fit.

Based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow model, we tested multiple versions of a flexible procedure we call data integration (DI) to leverage recent discharge measurements to improve forecasts. DI accepts lagged inputs either directly or through a convolutional neural network (CNN) unit. DI ubiquitously elevated streamflow forecast performance to unseen levels, reaching a record continental-scale median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient value of 0.86. Integrating moving-average discharge, discharge from the last few days, or even average discharge from the previous calendar month could all improve daily forecasts. Directly using lagged observations as inputs was comparable in performance to using the CNN unit. Importantly, we obtained valuable insights regarding hydrologic processes impacting LSTM and DI performance. Before applying DI, the base LSTM model worked well in mountainous or snow-dominated regions, but less well in regions with low discharge volumes (due to either low precipitation or high precipitation-energy synchronicity) and large inter-annual storage variability. DI was most beneficial in regions with high flow autocorrelation: it greatly reduced baseflow bias in groundwater-dominated western basins and also improved peak prediction for basins with dynamical surface water storage, such as the Prairie Potholes or Great Lakes regions. However, even DI cannot elevate high-aridity basins with one-day flash peaks.

The observed streamflows in the reference network have undergone generalized and significant decreases both at seasonal and annual scales during the study period. Annual rainfall, though, did not experienced statistically significant changes. The observed trends in streamflows can be attributed to either land-use changes, or to the statistically significant changes exhibited both by yearly potential evapotranspiration values and by the seasonal distribution of precipitation. In the attribution work conducted using both data-based and simulation-based methods, the intra-annual redistribution of precipitation is shown to be the main statistically significant climate-driver of streamflow change. The contributions of other non-climate factors, such as the change in land cover, to the reduction in annual streamflows are shown to be minor in comparison.', category='science', doi='10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.08.063', published_date='2020-08-18T07:06:31', engine='arxiv', tags=['physics.ao-ph', 'physics.app-ph'], authors=None, score=1.0, extra={'template': 'paper.html', 'authors': ['Patricio Yeste', 'Javier Dorador', 'Wenceslao Mart√≠n-Rosales', 'Emilio Molero', 'Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Esteban Parra'], 'journal': 'Journal of Hydrology 566 (2018) 55-72', 'comments': 'Published in Journal of Hydrology', 'parsed_url': ['http', 'arxiv.org', '/abs/2008.07771v1', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['arxiv'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0, 'pubdate': '2020-08-18 07:06:31'}, should_fetch_full_content=True, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={'topic_alignment': <TopicAlignmentLabel.ALIGNED: 'aligned'>, 'content_depth': <ContentDepthLabel.COMPREHENSIVE: 'comprehensive'>, 'recency_relevance': <RecencyRelevanceLabel.CURRENT: 'current'>, 'methodological_relevance': <MethodologicalRelevanceLabel.METHODOLOGICALLY_SOUND: 'methodologically_sound'>, 'evidence_quality': <EvidenceQualityLabel.HIGH_QUALITY_EVIDENCE: 'high_quality_evidence'>, 'scope_relevance': <ScopeRelevanceLabel.IN_SCOPE: 'in_scope'>, 'overall_relevance': <EnhancedRelevancyLabel.HIGHLY_RELEVANT: 'highly_relevant'>, 'reasoning_steps': [\"The query specifically seeks research on basin-scale water budgets with a focus on groundwater's role in streamflow, which aligns with the content of the provided papers.\", 'The papers discuss groundwater-surface water interactions, groundwater dating, and streamflow forecasting, all of which are relevant to understanding water budgets and the role of groundwater.', 'The content depth is comprehensive as it covers various aspects of groundwater and streamflow dynamics, including modeling, historical analysis, and climate impacts.', 'The recency of the studies is current, as they reflect recent research trends and methodologies in hydrology.', 'The methodologies used in the studies, such as Bayesian modeling and LSTM networks, are sound and appropriate for the research questions posed.', 'The evidence presented in the studies is of high quality, with robust data analysis and significant findings.', \"The scope of the papers is in line with the query, focusing on groundwater's contribution to streamflow and water budgets.\"]}, title_augmented='Climate-driven trends in the streamflow records of a reference hydrologic network in Southern Spain - (Published 2020-08-18T07:06:31)', relevancy_score=1.0), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR022669'), title='Estimating Basin‚ÄêScale Water Budgets With SMAP Soil Moisture Data', query='basin-scale water budgets groundwater streamflow', pdf_url=AnyUrl('https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180003454.pdf'), content='Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level‚Äê2 soil moisture retrievals collected during 2015‚Äì2017 are used in isolation to estimate 10‚Äêday warm season precipitation and streamflow totals within 145 medium‚Äêsized (2,000‚Äì10,000 km2) unregulated watersheds in the conterminous United States. The precipitation estimation algorithm, derived from a well‚Äêdocumented approach, includes a locally calibrated loss function component that significantly improves its performance. For the basin‚Äêscale water budget analysis, the precipitation and streamflow algorithms are calibrated with 2 years of SMAP retrievals in conjunction with observed precipitation and streamflow data and are then applied to SMAP retrievals alone during a third year. While estimation accuracy (as measured by the square of the correlation coefficient, r2, between estimates and observations) varies by basin, the average r2 for the basins is 0.53 for precipitation and 0.22 for streamflow. For the subset of 22 basins that calibrate particularly well, the r2 increases to 0.63 for precipitation and to 0.51 for streamflow. The magnitudes of the estimated variables are also accurate, with sample pairs generally clustered about the 1:1 line. The chief limitation to the estimation involves large biases induced during periods of high rainfall; the accuracy of the estimates (in terms of r2 and root‚Äêmean‚Äêsquare error) increases significantly when periods of higher rainfall are not considered. The potential for transferability is also demonstrated by calibrating the streamflow estimation equation in one basin and then applying the equation in another.

Recently, purely data-driven deep learning models like long short-term memory (LSTM) showed seemingly-insurmountable performance in modeling rainfall-runoff and other geoscientific variables, yet they cannot predict untrained physical variables and remain challenging to interpret. Here we show that differentiable, learnable, process-based models (called {\\\\delta} models here) can approach the performance level of LSTM for the intensively-observed variable (streamflow) with regionalized parameterization. We use a simple hydrologic model HBV as the backbone and use embedded neural networks, which can only be trained in a differentiable programming framework, to parameterize, enhance, or replace the process-based model modules. Without using an ensemble or post-processor, {\\\\delta} models can obtain a median Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.732 for 671 basins across the USA for the Daymet forcing dataset, compared to 0.748 from a state-of-the-art LSTM model with the same setup. For another forcing dataset, the difference is even smaller: 0.715 vs. 0.722. Meanwhile, the resulting learnable process-based models can output a full set of untrained variables, e.g., soil and groundwater storage, snowpack, evapotranspiration, and baseflow, and later be constrained by their observations. Both simulated evapotranspiration and fraction of discharge from baseflow agreed decently with alternative estimates. The general framework can work with models with various process complexity and opens up the path for learning physics from big data.', category='science', doi='10.1029/2022WR032404', published_date='2022-03-28T15:06:53', engine='arxiv', tags=['cs.LG'], authors=None, score=1.0, extra={'template': 'paper.html', 'authors': ['Dapeng Feng', 'Jiangtao Liu', 'Kathryn Lawson', 'Chaopeng Shen'], 'journal': 'Water Resources Research, 58 (2022)', 'comments': None, 'parsed_url': ['http', 'arxiv.org', '/abs/2203.14827v2', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['arxiv'], 'positions': [3], 'score': 0.3333333333333333, 'pubdate': '2022-03-28 15:06:53'}, should_fetch_full_content=True, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={'topic_alignment': <TopicAlignmentLabel.ALIGNED: 'aligned'>, 'content_depth': <ContentDepthLabel.COMPREHENSIVE: 'comprehensive'>, 'recency_relevance': <RecencyRelevanceLabel.CURRENT: 'current'>, 'methodological_relevance': <MethodologicalRelevanceLabel.METHODOLOGICALLY_SOUND: 'methodologically_sound'>, 'evidence_quality': <EvidenceQualityLabel.HIGH_QUALITY_EVIDENCE: 'high_quality_evidence'>, 'scope_relevance': <ScopeRelevanceLabel.IN_SCOPE: 'in_scope'>, 'overall_relevance': <EnhancedRelevancyLabel.HIGHLY_RELEVANT: 'highly_relevant'>, 'reasoning_steps': [\"The paper focuses on hydrologic predictions, which includes the role of groundwater in the water cycle, aligning with the query's focus on groundwater as a stable source for streamflow.\", 'The content provides a comprehensive analysis of a new modeling approach that integrates physical processes with machine learning, relevant to understanding water budgets.', 'The research is current, reflecting recent advancements in hydrologic modeling and prediction accuracy.', 'The methodology is sound, utilizing a differentiable, learnable process-based model that can output various hydrologic variables, including groundwater storage and baseflow.', \"The evidence quality is high, as it demonstrates the model's performance across multiple basins and datasets, providing robust results.\", 'The scope of the paper is appropriate as it addresses the integration of groundwater and other hydrologic variables in the context of water budgets and streamflow.']}, title_augmented='Differentiable, learnable, regionalized process-based models with physical outputs can approach state-of-the-art hydrologic prediction accuracy - (Published 2022-03-28T15:06:53)', relevancy_score=1.0), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36c626800e9c95d6e05a2e06bd6a83789ad385c2'), title='Mining and Climate Change Alters Water Storage and Streamflow Dynamics of Northern Peatland‚ÄêDominated Catchments', query='regional studies groundwater streamflow dynamics', pdf_url=None, content='The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) of northern Ontario, a globally significant carbon store, are characterized by expansive peatland complexes of patterned bogs and fens, which play a vital role in regional water regulation. These peatlands are threatened by disturbance from large‚Äêscale resource extraction and projected climate change, both of which have the potential to compromise their ecohydrological function. Field measurements and numerical modeling were used to investigate the hydrological responses of peatlands and downgradient streamflow as a consequence of disturbance from mining and shifts in climate, individually and in combination. Mine dewatering reduced groundwater storage by as much as 150 mm, equivalent to a water table lowering of 75 cm, thereby decreasing annual streamflow by 66% in impacted tributaries. Although the projected increases to precipitation and evapotranspiration due to climate change were approximately balanced, resulting in minor changes to storage, there were pronounced shifts in the temporal patterns of streamflow, with a diminished snowmelt and spring freshet occurring a month earlier. When considering the cumulative impacts of climate change coupled with mining, a potential shift in peatland ecohydrology toward new equilibria is plausible, implying altered water movement across the landscape and compromised ecosystem function. This study emphasizes the critical need for further monitoring and modeling efforts to characterize the thresholds and mechanisms driving these ecohydrological changes.

This study evaluated the effects of climate perturbations on snowmelt, soil\\nmoisture, and streamflow generation in small Canadian Prairies basins using a modelling approach based on classification of basin biophysical characteristics. Seven basin classes that encompass the entirety of the\\nPrairies Ecozone in Canada were determined by cluster analysis of these\\ncharacteristics. Individual semi-distributed virtual basin (VB) models\\nrepresenting these classes were parameterized in the Cold Regions\\nHydrological Model (CRHM) platform, which includes modules for snowmelt and\\nsublimation, soil freezing and thawing, actual evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture dynamics, groundwater recharge, and depressional storage dynamics including fill and spill runoff generation and variable connected areas. Precipitation (P) and temperature (T) perturbation scenarios covering the range of climate model predictions for the 21st\\xa0century were used to evaluate climate sensitivity of hydrological processes in individual land cover and basin types across the Prairies Ecozone. Results indicated that snow accumulation in wetlands had a greater sensitivity to P and T than that in croplands and grasslands in all basin types. Wetland soil moisture was also more sensitive to T than the cropland and grassland soil moisture. Jointly influenced by land cover distribution and local climate, basin-average snow accumulation was more sensitive to T in the drier and grassland-characterized basins than in the wetter basins dominated by cropland, whilst basin-average soil moisture was most sensitive to T and P perturbations in basins typified by pothole depressions and broad river valleys. Annual streamflow had the greatest sensitivities to T and P in the dry and poorly connected Interior Grasslands (See Fig.\\xa01) basins but the smallest in the wet and well-connected Southern Manitoba basins. The ability of P to compensate for warming-induced reductions in snow accumulation and streamflow was much higher in the wetter and cropland-dominated basins than in the drier and grassland-characterized basins, whilst decreases in cropland soil moisture induced by the maximum expected warming of 6\\u2009‚àòC could be fully offset by a P increase of 11\\u2009% in all basins. These results can be used to (1)\\xa0identify locations which had the largest hydrological sensitivities to changing climate and (2)\\xa0diagnose underlying processes responsible for hydrological responses to expected climate change. Variations of hydrological sensitivity in land cover and basin types suggest that different water management and adaptation methods are needed to address enhanced water stress due to expected climate change in different regions of the Prairies Ecozone.\\n', category='science', doi='10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023', published_date='2023', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['Zhihua He', 'K.

The representation of groundwater is simplified in most regional climate models (RCMs), potentially leading to biases in the simulations. This study introduces a unique dataset from the regional Terrestrial Systems Modelling Platform (TSMP) driven by the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model at Low Resolution (MPI-ESM-LR) boundary conditions in the context of dynamical downscaling of global climate models (GCMs) for climate change studies. TSMP explicitly simulates full 3D soil and groundwater dynamics together with overland flow, including complete water and energy cycles from the bedrock to the top of the atmosphere. By comparing the statistics of heat events, i.e., a series of consecutive days with a near-surface temperature exceeding the 90th percentile of the reference period, from TSMP and those from GCM‚ÄìRCM simulations with simplified groundwater dynamics from the COordinated Regional Climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX) for the European domain, we aim to improve the understanding of how groundwater representation affects heat events in Europe. The analysis was carried out using RCM outputs for the summer seasons of 1976‚Äì2005 relative to the reference period of 1961‚Äì1990. While our results show that TSMP simulates heat events consistently with the CORDEX ensemble, there are some systematic differences that we attribute to the more realistic representation of groundwater in TSMP. Compared to the CORDEX ensemble, TSMP simulates fewer hot days (i.e., days with a near-surface temperature exceeding the 90th percentile of the reference period) and lower interannual variability and decadal change in the number of hot days on average over Europe. TSMP systematically simulates fewer heat waves (i.e., heat events lasting 6\\u2009d or more) compared to the CORDEX ensemble; moreover, they are shorter and less intense. The Iberian Peninsula is particularly sensitive with respect to groundwater. Therefore, incorporating an explicit 3D groundwater representation in RCMs may be a key in reducing biases in simulated duration, intensity, and frequency of heat waves in Europe. The results highlight the importance of hydrological processes for the long-term regional climate simulations and provide indications of possible potential implications for climate change projections.\\n', category='science', doi='10.5194/esd-15-167-2024', published_date='2024', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['L.

However, this relationship is rarely explicitly examined because of the complexity of surface to subsurface processes and the diverse impacts of multiple drivers, such as groundwater pumping and land use changes. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing methods to quantify the sensitivity of groundwater level and recharge to temporal climate variability across Australia. Using the HydroSight groundwater hydrograph toolbox we first identify 1,143 out of a total of 4,350 bores as climate‚Äêdriven, where historically, head was primarily driven by climate variations. Streamflow elasticity measures are then adapted to groundwater to quantify the long‚Äêterm head and recharge sensitivity. We find that the national median sensitivity of head and recharge to precipitation change are 42 and 0.43 mm mm‚àí1, respectively (interquartiles: 20‚Äì77 and 0.30‚Äì0.55 mm mm‚àí1); both of which are ‚àº8 times that of potential evapotranspiration. Nationally, the results are spatially correlated, suggestive of large‚Äêscale effects. The responses of head and recharge appear to be primarily related to climate type and hydrogeology. The more arid the climate, the higher the head sensitivity but the lower the recharge sensitivity. Porous media generally show higher head sensitivity than fractured media due to smaller aquifer specific yield, and again contrarily for that of recharge.

Many of the studies shed light on conditions on a local scale only, without exploring a regional angle. To provide a broad and historical overview of groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction, a review of research carried out in Denmark was undertaken due to the high density of studies conducted in the country. The extent to which this topic has been investigated is related to Denmark's physiography and climate, the presence of numerous streams and lakes combined with shallow groundwater, and historical, funding, and administrative decisions. Study topics comprise groundwater detection techniques, numerical modeling, and contaminant issues including nutrients, ranging from point studies all the way to studies at national scale. The increase in studies in recent decades corresponds with the need to maintain the good status of groundwater‚Äêdependent ecosystems and protect groundwater resources. This review of three decades of research revealed that problems such as the difference in scales between numerical models and field observations, interdisciplinary research integrating hydrological and biological methods, and the effect of local processes in regional systems remain persistent challenges. Technical progress in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, distributed temperature sensing, and new cost‚Äêeffective methods for detecting groundwater discharge as well as the increasing computing capacity of numerical models emerge as opportunities for dealing with complex natural systems that are subject to modifications in future triggered by climate change.This article is categorized under: Science of Water > Hydrological Processes Science of Water > Water and Environmental Change Water and Life > Nature of Freshwater Ecosystems\", category='science', doi=None, published_date=None, engine='openairepublications', tags=None, authors=None, score=1.0, extra={'template': 'default.html', 'parsed_url': ['https', 'doi.org', '/10.1002/wat2.1664', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['openairepublications'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0}, should_fetch_full_content=True, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={'topic_alignment': <TopicAlignmentLabel.ALIGNED: 'aligned'>, 'content_depth': <ContentDepthLabel.COMPREHENSIVE: 'comprehensive'>, 'recency_relevance': <RecencyRelevanceLabel.CURRENT: 'current'>, 'methodological_relevance': <MethodologicalRelevanceLabel.METHODOLOGICALLY_SOUND: 'methodologically_sound'>, 'evidence_quality': <EvidenceQualityLabel.HIGH_QUALITY_EVIDENCE: 'high_quality_evidence'>, 'scope_relevance': <ScopeRelevanceLabel.IN_SCOPE: 'in_scope'>, 'overall_relevance': <EnhancedRelevancyLabel.HIGHLY_RELEVANT: 'highly_relevant'>, 'reasoning_steps': [\"The topic of groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction is directly related to basin-scale water budgets, particularly in understanding groundwater's role in streamflow.\", 'The content provides a comprehensive review of groundwater studies in Denmark, which includes various scales and methodologies relevant to the query.', 'The research is recent and reflects current trends and challenges in groundwater management and its implications for streamflow.', 'The methodologies discussed, such as numerical modeling and groundwater detection techniques, are sound and relevant to the study of water budgets.', 'The evidence presented in the review is of high quality, as it synthesizes three decades of research and addresses significant challenges in the field.', 'The scope of the article is appropriate as it covers both local and regional aspects of groundwater interaction, which is essential for understanding basin-scale water budgets.']}, title_augmented='Groundwater‚Äìsurface water interaction in Denmark', relevancy_score=1.0), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10103v1'), title='Multi-Tracer Groundwater Dating in Southern Oman using Bayesian Modelling', query='methodologies assessing groundwater contributions streamflow', pdf_url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10103v1'), content='In the scope of assessing aquifer systems in areas where freshwater is scarce, estimation of transit times is a vital step to quantify the effect of groundwater abstraction. Transit time distributions of different shapes, mean residence times, and contributions are used to represent the hydrogeological conditions in aquifer systems and are typically inferred from measured tracer concentrations by inverse modeling. In this study, a multi-tracer sampling campaign was conducted in the Salalah Plain in Southern Oman including CFCs, SF6, 39Ar, 14C, and 4He. Based on the data of three tracers, a two-component Dispersion Model (DMmix) and a nonparametric model with six age bins were assumed and evaluated using Bayesian statistics. In a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, the maximum likelihood parameter estimates and their uncertainties were determined. Model performance was assessed using Bayes factor and leave-one-out cross-validation. Both models suggest that the groundwater in the Salalah Plain is composed of a very young component below 30 yr and a very old component beyond 1,000 yr, with the nonparametric model performing slightly better than the DMmix model. All wells except one exhibit reasonable goodness of fit. Our results support the relevance of Bayesian modeling in hydrology and the potential of nonparametric models for an adequate representation of aquifer dynamics.', category='science', doi='10.1029/2021WR031776', published_date='2022-09-05T14:33:51', engine='arxiv', tags=['physics.geo-ph', 'physics.atom-ph', 'stat.AP'], authors=None, score=1.0, extra={'template': 'paper.html', 'authors': ['Viola R√§dle', 'Arne Kersting', 'Maximilian Schmidt', 'Lisa Ringena', 'Julian Robertz', 'Werner Aeschbach', 'Markus Oberthaler', 'Thomas M√ºller'], 'journal': 'Water Resources Research, 2022, Volume58, Issue6', 'comments': '21 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables', 'parsed_url': ['http', 'arxiv.org', '/abs/2209.10103v1', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['arxiv'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0, 'pubdate': '2022-09-05 14:33:51'}, should_fetch_full_content=True, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={'topic_alignment': <TopicAlignmentLabel.ALIGNED: 'aligned'>, 'content_depth': <ContentDepthLabel.COMPREHENSIVE: 'comprehensive'>, 'recency_relevance': <RecencyRelevanceLabel.CURRENT: 'current'>, 'methodological_relevance': <MethodologicalRelevanceLabel.METHODOLOGICALLY_SOUND: 'methodologically_sound'>, 'evidence_quality': <EvidenceQualityLabel.HIGH_QUALITY_EVIDENCE: 'high_quality_evidence'>, 'scope_relevance': <ScopeRelevanceLabel.IN_SCOPE: 'in_scope'>, 'overall_relevance': <EnhancedRelevancyLabel.HIGHLY_RELEVANT: 'highly_relevant'>, 'reasoning_steps': [\"The topic of groundwater's role in streamflow is directly addressed in the content, making it aligned with the query.\", 'The content provides a comprehensive overview of groundwater-surface water interactions, which is relevant to basin-scale water budgets.', 'The research is recent and discusses current methodologies and findings in groundwater studies.', 'The methodology used in the study is sound, employing Bayesian modeling and multi-tracer techniques, which are appropriate for hydrological research.', 'The evidence presented in the study is of high quality, supported by rigorous statistical analysis and modeling.', \"The scope of the research is appropriate as it focuses on groundwater's role in hydrology, which is central to the query.\", \"Overall, the paper is highly relevant as it discusses groundwater's importance in the context of water budgets and streamflow.\"]}, title_augmented='Multi-Tracer Groundwater Dating in Southern Oman using Bayesian Modelling - (Published 2022-09-05T14:33:51)', relevancy_score=1.0), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08949v3'), title='Enhancing streamflow forecast and extracting insights using long-short term memory networks with data integration at continental scales', query='regional studies groundwater streamflow dynamics', pdf_url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08949v3'), content='Recent observations with varied schedules and types (moving average, snapshot, or regularly spaced) can help to improve streamflow forecasts, but it is challenging to integrate them effectively. Based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow model, we tested multiple versions of a flexible procedure we call data integration (DI) to leverage recent discharge measurements to improve forecasts. DI accepts lagged inputs either directly or through a convolutional neural network (CNN) unit. DI ubiquitously elevated streamflow forecast performance to unseen levels, reaching a record continental-scale median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient value of 0.86. Integrating moving-average discharge, discharge from the last few days, or even average discharge from the previous calendar month could all improve daily forecasts. Directly using lagged observations as inputs was comparable in performance to using the CNN unit. Importantly, we obtained valuable insights regarding hydrologic processes impacting LSTM and DI performance. Before applying DI, the base LSTM model worked well in mountainous or snow-dominated regions, but less well in regions with low discharge volumes (due to either low precipitation or high precipitation-energy synchronicity) and large inter-annual storage variability. DI was most beneficial in regions with high flow autocorrelation: it greatly reduced baseflow bias in groundwater-dominated western basins and also improved peak prediction for basins with dynamical surface water storage, such as the Prairie Potholes or Great Lakes regions. However, even DI cannot elevate high-aridity basins with one-day flash peaks. Despite this limitation, there is much promise for a deep-learning-based forecast paradigm due to its performance, automation, efficiency, and flexibility.', category='science', doi='10.1029/2019WR026793', published_date='2019-12-18T23:44:00', engine='arxiv', tags=['cs.LG', 'stat.ML'], authors=None, score=1.0, extra={'template': 'paper.html', 'authors': ['Dapeng Feng', 'Kuai Fang', 'Chaopeng Shen'], 'journal': 'Water Resources Research, 2020', 'comments': None, 'parsed_url': ['http', 'arxiv.org', '/abs/1912.08949v3', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['arxiv'], 'positions': [1], 'score': 1.0, 'pubdate': '2019-12-18 23:44:00'}, should_fetch_full_content=True, query_alignment_details={}, relevancy_assessment={'topic_alignment': <TopicAlignmentLabel.ALIGNED: 'aligned'>, 'content_depth': <ContentDepthLabel.COMPREHENSIVE: 'comprehensive'>, 'recency_relevance': <RecencyRelevanceLabel.CURRENT: 'current'>, 'methodological_relevance': <MethodologicalRelevanceLabel.METHODOLOGICALLY_SOUND: 'methodologically_sound'>, 'evidence_quality': <EvidenceQualityLabel.HIGH_QUALITY_EVIDENCE: 'high_quality_evidence'>, 'scope_relevance': <ScopeRelevanceLabel.IN_SCOPE: 'in_scope'>, 'overall_relevance': <EnhancedRelevancyLabel.HIGHLY_RELEVANT: 'highly_relevant'>, 'reasoning_steps': [\"The query specifically seeks research on basin-scale water budgets with a focus on groundwater's role in streamflow, which aligns with the content of the papers provided.\", 'The content of the papers discusses groundwater interactions, modeling, and forecasting, which are comprehensive in addressing the role of groundwater in hydrology.', 'The papers are recent and reflect current research trends in hydrology and groundwater studies.', 'The methodologies used in the studies, such as Bayesian modeling and LSTM networks, are sound and appropriate for the research questions posed.', 'The evidence presented in the studies is robust, with clear methodologies and results that support the findings.', \"The scope of the papers is relevant to the query, as they all discuss groundwater's role in streamflow and basin-scale water budgets.\"]}, title_augmented='Enhancing streamflow forecast and extracting insights using long-short term memory networks with data integration at continental scales - (Published 2019-12-18T23:44:00)', relevancy_score=1.0), DeepSearchResultItem(url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07771v1'), title='Climate-driven trends in the streamflow records of a reference hydrologic network in Southern Spain', query='climate change land use impacts groundwater streamflow', pdf_url=AnyUrl('http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07771v1'), content='Monthly streamflow records from a set of gauging stations, selected to form a reference hydrologic network, are analyzed together with precipitation and temperature data to establish whether the streamflows in the Guadalquivir River Basin have experienced changes during the last half of the XXth century that can be attributed to hydrological forcing. The observed streamflows in the reference network have undergone generalized and significant decreases both at seasonal and annual scales during the study period. Annual rainfall, though, did not experienced statistically significant changes. The observed trends in streamflows can be attributed to either land-use changes, or to the statistically significant changes exhibited both by yearly potential evapotranspiration values and by the seasonal distribution of precipitation. In the attribution work conducted using both data-based and simulation-based methods, the intra-annual redistribution of precipitation is shown to be the main statistically significant climate-driver of streamflow change.

The precipitation estimation algorithm, derived from a well‚Äêdocumented approach, includes a locally calibrated loss function component that significantly improves its performance. For the basin‚Äêscale water budget analysis, the precipitation and streamflow algorithms are calibrated with 2 years of SMAP retrievals in conjunction with observed precipitation and streamflow data and are then applied to SMAP retrievals alone during a third year. While estimation accuracy (as measured by the square of the correlation coefficient, r2, between estimates and observations) varies by basin, the average r2 for the basins is 0.53 for precipitation and 0.22 for streamflow. For the subset of 22 basins that calibrate particularly well, the r2 increases to 0.63 for precipitation and to 0.51 for streamflow. The magnitudes of the estimated variables are also accurate, with sample pairs generally clustered about the 1:1 line. The chief limitation to the estimation involves large biases induced during periods of high rainfall; the accuracy of the estimates (in terms of r2 and root‚Äêmean‚Äêsquare error) increases significantly when periods of higher rainfall are not considered. The potential for transferability is also demonstrated by calibrating the streamflow estimation equation in one basin and then applying the equation in another.

Recently, purely data-driven deep learning models like long short-term memory (LSTM) showed seemingly-insurmountable performance in modeling rainfall-runoff and other geoscientific variables, yet they cannot predict untrained physical variables and remain challenging to interpret. Here we show that differentiable, learnable, process-based models (called {\\\\delta} models here) can approach the performance level of LSTM for the intensively-observed variable (streamflow) with regionalized parameterization. We use a simple hydrologic model HBV as the backbone and use embedded neural networks, which can only be trained in a differentiable programming framework, to parameterize, enhance, or replace the process-based model modules. Without using an ensemble or post-processor, {\\\\delta} models can obtain a median Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.732 for 671 basins across the USA for the Daymet forcing dataset, compared to 0.748 from a state-of-the-art LSTM model with the same setup. For another forcing dataset, the difference is even smaller: 0.715 vs. 0.722. Meanwhile, the resulting learnable process-based models can output a full set of untrained variables, e.g., soil and groundwater storage, snowpack, evapotranspiration, and baseflow, and later be constrained by their observations. Both simulated evapotranspiration and fraction of discharge from baseflow agreed decently with alternative estimates.

These peatlands are threatened by disturbance from large‚Äêscale resource extraction and projected climate change, both of which have the potential to compromise their ecohydrological function. Field measurements and numerical modeling were used to investigate the hydrological responses of peatlands and downgradient streamflow as a consequence of disturbance from mining and shifts in climate, individually and in combination. Mine dewatering reduced groundwater storage by as much as 150 mm, equivalent to a water table lowering of 75 cm, thereby decreasing annual streamflow by 66% in impacted tributaries. Although the projected increases to precipitation and evapotranspiration due to climate change were approximately balanced, resulting in minor changes to storage, there were pronounced shifts in the temporal patterns of streamflow, with a diminished snowmelt and spring freshet occurring a month earlier. When considering the cumulative impacts of climate change coupled with mining, a potential shift in peatland ecohydrology toward new equilibria is plausible, implying altered water movement across the landscape and compromised ecosystem function. This study emphasizes the critical need for further monitoring and modeling efforts to characterize the thresholds and mechanisms driving these ecohydrological changes. This research will guide future investigations on the implications of disturbance on local and regional hydrologic connectivity and facilitate the protection of peatland ecosystems in the HBL and other northern peatland‚Äêdominated landscapes.', category='science', doi='10.1029/2024WR037310', published_date='2024', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['O.

This study evaluated the effects of climate perturbations on snowmelt, soil\\nmoisture, and streamflow generation in small Canadian Prairies basins using a modelling approach based on classification of basin biophysical characteristics. Seven basin classes that encompass the entirety of the\\nPrairies Ecozone in Canada were determined by cluster analysis of these\\ncharacteristics. Individual semi-distributed virtual basin (VB) models\\nrepresenting these classes were parameterized in the Cold Regions\\nHydrological Model (CRHM) platform, which includes modules for snowmelt and\\nsublimation, soil freezing and thawing, actual evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture dynamics, groundwater recharge, and depressional storage dynamics including fill and spill runoff generation and variable connected areas. Precipitation (P) and temperature (T) perturbation scenarios covering the range of climate model predictions for the 21st\\xa0century were used to evaluate climate sensitivity of hydrological processes in individual land cover and basin types across the Prairies Ecozone. Results indicated that snow accumulation in wetlands had a greater sensitivity to P and T than that in croplands and grasslands in all basin types. Wetland soil moisture was also more sensitive to T than the cropland and grassland soil moisture. Jointly influenced by land cover distribution and local climate, basin-average snow accumulation was more sensitive to T in the drier and grassland-characterized basins than in the wetter basins dominated by cropland, whilst basin-average soil moisture was most sensitive to T and P perturbations in basins typified by pothole depressions and broad river valleys. Annual streamflow had the greatest sensitivities to T and P in the dry and poorly connected Interior Grasslands (See Fig.\\xa01) basins but the smallest in the wet and well-connected Southern Manitoba basins. The ability of P to compensate for warming-induced reductions in snow accumulation and streamflow was much higher in the wetter and cropland-dominated basins than in the drier and grassland-characterized basins, whilst decreases in cropland soil moisture induced by the maximum expected warming of 6\\u2009‚àòC could be fully offset by a P increase of 11\\u2009% in all basins. These results can be used to (1)\\xa0identify locations which had the largest hydrological sensitivities to changing climate and (2)\\xa0diagnose underlying processes responsible for hydrological responses to expected climate change. Variations of hydrological sensitivity in land cover and basin types suggest that different water management and adaptation methods are needed to address enhanced water stress due to expected climate change in different regions of the Prairies Ecozone.\\n', category='science', doi='10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023', published_date='2023', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['Zhihua He', 'K.

The representation of groundwater is simplified in most regional climate models (RCMs), potentially leading to biases in the simulations. This study introduces a unique dataset from the regional Terrestrial Systems Modelling Platform (TSMP) driven by the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model at Low Resolution (MPI-ESM-LR) boundary conditions in the context of dynamical downscaling of global climate models (GCMs) for climate change studies. TSMP explicitly simulates full 3D soil and groundwater dynamics together with overland flow, including complete water and energy cycles from the bedrock to the top of the atmosphere. By comparing the statistics of heat events, i.e., a series of consecutive days with a near-surface temperature exceeding the 90th percentile of the reference period, from TSMP and those from GCM‚ÄìRCM simulations with simplified groundwater dynamics from the COordinated Regional Climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX) for the European domain, we aim to improve the understanding of how groundwater representation affects heat events in Europe. The analysis was carried out using RCM outputs for the summer seasons of 1976‚Äì2005 relative to the reference period of 1961‚Äì1990. While our results show that TSMP simulates heat events consistently with the CORDEX ensemble, there are some systematic differences that we attribute to the more realistic representation of groundwater in TSMP. Compared to the CORDEX ensemble, TSMP simulates fewer hot days (i.e., days with a near-surface temperature exceeding the 90th percentile of the reference period) and lower interannual variability and decadal change in the number of hot days on average over Europe. TSMP systematically simulates fewer heat waves (i.e., heat events lasting 6\\u2009d or more) compared to the CORDEX ensemble; moreover, they are shorter and less intense. The Iberian Peninsula is particularly sensitive with respect to groundwater. Therefore, incorporating an explicit 3D groundwater representation in RCMs may be a key in reducing biases in simulated duration, intensity, and frequency of heat waves in Europe. The results highlight the importance of hydrological processes for the long-term regional climate simulations and provide indications of possible potential implications for climate change projections.\\n', category='science', doi='10.5194/esd-15-167-2024', published_date='2024', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['L.

However, this relationship is rarely explicitly examined because of the complexity of surface to subsurface processes and the diverse impacts of multiple drivers, such as groundwater pumping and land use changes. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing methods to quantify the sensitivity of groundwater level and recharge to temporal climate variability across Australia. Using the HydroSight groundwater hydrograph toolbox we first identify 1,143 out of a total of 4,350 bores as climate‚Äêdriven, where historically, head was primarily driven by climate variations. Streamflow elasticity measures are then adapted to groundwater to quantify the long‚Äêterm head and recharge sensitivity. We find that the national median sensitivity of head and recharge to precipitation change are 42 and 0.43 mm mm‚àí1, respectively (interquartiles: 20‚Äì77 and 0.30‚Äì0.55 mm mm‚àí1); both of which are ‚àº8 times that of potential evapotranspiration. Nationally, the results are spatially correlated, suggestive of large‚Äêscale effects. The responses of head and recharge appear to be primarily related to climate type and hydrogeology. The more arid the climate, the higher the head sensitivity but the lower the recharge sensitivity. Porous media generally show higher head sensitivity than fractured media due to smaller aquifer specific yield, and again contrarily for that of recharge. These findings contribute to understanding the long‚Äêterm impact of climate change on groundwater and thus provide valuable insights for sustainable groundwater management.', category='science', doi='10.1029/2023WR035036', published_date='2023', engine='semanticscholar', tags=['Xinyang Fan', 'T.

                        "This report synthesizes recent research on basin-scale water budgets with a focus on the role of groundwater as a stable and significant source for streamflow. The aim is to understand the methodologies used to assess groundwater contributions, explore case studies from various basins, and evaluate the implications of groundwater on hydrological models.\n",
                        "\n",
                        "## Methodologies for Assessing Groundwater Contributions\n",
                        "Several methodologies have been employed to assess groundwater contributions to streamflow. The Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) has been widely used for both event-based and continuous hydrological modeling. Event-based modeling is effective for short-term hydrological responses, while continuous modeling captures long-term processes such as soil moisture dynamics and groundwater contributions [Hydrology, 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrology12020039).\n",
                        "\n",
                        "Another approach involves using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data combined with baseflow separation techniques to estimate groundwater recharge at large spatial scales. This method has been applied in karst basins in Southwest China, demonstrating the influence of karstification on groundwater recharge and discharge processes [Water Resources Research, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR032091).\n",

                        "In the Wujiang and Xijiang River Basins, GRACE data was used to estimate groundwater recharge, showing significant variability depending on the degree of karstification. The study highlighted the rapid infiltration and discharge capabilities in more karstic areas, particularly during dry periods [Water Resources Research, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR032091).\n",

                        "In the Tao‚Äôer River Basin, groundwater recharge was primarily through rainfall percolation, with baseflow accounting for a significant portion of the discharge. The study emphasized the importance of understanding groundwater dynamics for effective water resource management in mountainous regions [Environmental Earth Sciences, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-09974-z).\n",

                        "The integration of groundwater dynamics into hydrological models is crucial for accurate streamflow predictions. Models that incorporate higher soil permeability, such as those using the Noah land surface model, have shown improved streamflow predictions across various scales [Water Resources Research, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR033075).\n",
                        "\n",
                        "Additionally, the use of convergent cross-mapping (CCM) has been explored to identify causal interactions between groundwater and streamflow, providing insights into hydrological processes that are not easily captured through traditional methods [Water Resources Research, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021WR030231).\n",

                        "Groundwater plays a critical role in maintaining streamflow, particularly in regions with significant karstification or mountainous terrain. The methodologies and case studies reviewed highlight the importance of integrating groundwater dynamics into hydrological models to enhance the accuracy of water budget assessments. Future research should focus on improving model calibration and exploring new techniques for assessing groundwater contributions at various scales.\n",

The authors characterize the dynamics associated with streamflow time series data from about seventy-one U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream-gauge stations in the state of Iowa. They employ a novel approach called visibility graph (VG). It uses the concept of mapping time series into complex networks to investigate the time evolutionary behavior of dynamical system. The authors focus on a simple variant of VG algorithm called horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The tracking of dynamics and hence, the predictability of streamflow processes, are carried out by extracting two key pieces of information called characteristic exponent, {\\\\lambda} of degree distribution and global clustering coefficient, GC pertaining to HVG derived network. The authors use these two measures to identify whether streamflow process has its origin in random or chaotic processes. They show that the characterization of streamflow dynamics is sensitive to data attributes. Through a systematic and comprehensive analysis, the authors illustrate that streamflow dynamics characterization is sensitive to the normalization, and the time-scale of streamflow time-series. At daily scale, streamflow at all stations used in the analysis, reveals randomness with strong spatial scale (basin size) dependence. This has implications for predictability of streamflow and floods. The authors demonstrate that dynamics transition through potentially chaotic to randomly correlated process as the averaging time-scale increases. Finally, the temporal trends of {\\\\lambda} and GC are statistically significant at about 40% of the total number of stations analyzed.

Groundwater is widely used to supply water for drinking, industry, and agriculture purposes. The groundwater quality measurements vary for different climates and various human behaviors, and consequently, their spatial variability can be substantial. In this paper, we aim to analyze a groundwater dataset from the Golestan province, Iran, for November 2003 to November 2013. Our target response variable to monitor the quality of groundwater is the number of counts that the quality of water is good for a drink. Hence, we are facing spatial count data. Due to the ubiquity of over or underdispersion in count data, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach based on the renewal theory that relates nonexponential waiting times between events and the distribution of the counts, relaxing the assumption of equidispersion at the cost of an additional parameter. Particularly, we extend the methodology for the analysis of spatial count data based on the gamma distribution assumption for waiting times. The model can be formulated as a latent Gaussian model, and therefore, we can carry out the fast computation by using the integrated nested Laplace approximation method.

The natural variability of streamflow is being complicated by anthropogenic influences and climate change, which may introduce additional complexity into the phenomenological records. To address this question for daily discharge data recorded during the period 1989-2016 at twelve gauging stations on Brazos River in Texas (USA), we use a set of novel quantitative tools: Kolmogorov complexity (KC) with its derivative associated measures to assess complexity, and Lyapunov time (LT) to assess predictability. We find that all daily discharge series exhibit long memory with an increasing downflow tendency, while the randomness of the series at individual sites cannot be definitively concluded. All Kolmogorov complexity measures have relatively small values with the exception of the USGS (United States Geological Survey) 08088610 station at Graford, Texas, which exhibits the highest values of these complexity measures. This finding may be attributed to the elevated effect of human activities at Graford, and proportionally lesser effect at other stations. In addition, complexity tends to decrease downflow, meaning that larger catchments are generally less influenced by anthropogenic activity. The correction on randomness of Lyapunov time (quantifying predictability) is found to be inversely proportional to the Kolmogorov complexity, which strengthens our conclusion regarding the effect of anthropogenic activities, considering that KC and LT are distinct measures, based on rather different techniques.', 'doi': '10.1016/j.physa.2019.03.041', 'authors': ['Dragutin T.

From among the different contaminants, the presence of heavy metals like cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), and lead (Pb) proves to have serious dangers when present in huge concentrations in groundwater. Long-term usage of these poisonous components may lead to neurological disorders, kidney failure and different sorts of cancer. To address these issues, this study developed a machine learning-based predictive model to evaluate the Groundwater Quality Index (GWQI) and identify the main contaminants which are affecting the water quality. It has been achieved with the help of a hybrid machine learning model i.e. LCBoost Fusion . The model has undergone several processes like data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning using Differential Evolution (DE) optimization, and evaluation through cross-validation. The LCBoost Fusion model outperforms individual models (CatBoost and LightGBM), by achieving low RMSE (0.6829), MSE (0.5102), MAE (0.3147) and a high R$^2$ score of 0.9809. Feature importance analysis highlights Potassium (K), Fluoride (F) and Total Hardness (TH) as the most influential indicators of groundwater contamination. This research successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning in assessing groundwater quality risks in Odisha. The proposed LCBoost Fusion model offers a reliable and efficient approach for real-time groundwater monitoring and risk mitigation.

One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States (CONUS) has demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it using historical streamflow measurements. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in catchments not used in training) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model: a gain in median NSE from 0.56 to 0.64 (time-split experiment) and from 0.30 to 0.34 (basin-split experiment).

These different scenarios have profoundly different implications for Mars' climatic history, and thus for its habitability in the distant past. Recent studies on Earth revealed that channel networks in arid landscapes with more surface runoff branch at narrower angles, while in humid environments with more groundwater flow, branching angles are much wider. We find that valley networks on Mars generally tend to branch at narrow angles similar to those found in arid landscapes on Earth.

However, this trend is not yet reflected in sensitivity analyses aimed at determining the relevant parameters to calibrate, where streamflow has traditionally played a leading role. On the basis of a Pareto optimization approach, we propose a framework to integrate the temporal dynamics of streamflow and evaporation into the sensitivity analysis and calibration stages of the hydrologic modeling exercise, here referred to as Pareto-based sensitivity analysis and multiobjective calibration. The framework is successfully applied to a case study using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model in three catchments located in Spain as representative of the different hydroclimatic conditions within the Iberian Peninsula. Several VIC vegetation parameters were identified as important to the performance estimates for evaporation during sensitivity analysis, and therefore were suitable candidates to improve the model representation of evaporative fluxes. Sensitivities for the streamflow performance, in turn, were mostly driven by the soil and routing parameters, with little contribution from the vegetation parameters. The multiobjective calibration experiments were carried out for the most parsimonious parameterization after a comparative analysis of the performance gains and losses for streamflow and evaporation, and yielded optimal adjustments for both hydrologic variables simultaneously.

Traditional hydrologic modeling approaches simulate streamflow by establishing connections across multiple physical processes, such as rainfall and runoff. These data, inherently connected both spatially and temporally, possess intrinsic causal relations that can be leveraged for robust and accurate forecasting. Recently, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have been adopted, excelling in various domains, such as urban traffic management, weather forecasting, and pandemic control, and they also promise advances in streamflow management. However, learning causal relationships directly from vast observational data is theoretically and computationally challenging. In this study, we employ a river flow graph as prior knowledge to facilitate the learning of the causal structure and then use the learned causal graph to predict streamflow at targeted sites. The proposed model, Causal Streamflow Forecasting (CSF) is tested in a real-world study in the Brazos River basin in Texas. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms regular spatio-temporal graph neural networks and achieves higher computational efficiency compared to traditional simulation methods.

This limitation is largely avoided by integrating data from Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) precipitation systems with widely available streamflow, land cover, and other Geographic Information System data sets. Such data integration facilitates development of rapid and reliable methods for estimating hydrologic fluxes at desirable temporal and spatial scales. In this study, we calculate ratios of streamflow to NEXRAD rainfall over the peak growing season for 40 watersheds across Michigan and use these to evaluate the landscape factors that influence groundwater recharge rates. Results indicate that ratios of streamflow and baseflow to rainfall are strongly influenced by land cover attributes.

We assess the significance of groundwater storage for seasonal streamflow forecasts by evaluating its contribution to interannual streamflow anomalies in the 29 tributary sub-basins of the Colorado River. Monthly and annual changes in total basin storage are simulated by two implementations of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model ‚Äì the standard release of the model, and an alternate version that has been modified to include the SIMple Groundwater Model (SIMGM), which represents an unconfined aquifer underlying the soil column. These estimates are compared to those resulting from basin-scale water balances derived exclusively from observational data and changes in terrestrial water storage from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. Changes in simulated groundwater storage are then compared to those derived via baseflow recession analysis for 72 reference-quality watersheds. Finally, estimates are statistically analyzed for relationships to interannual streamflow anomalies, and predictive capacities are compared across storage terms. We find that both model simulations result in similar estimates of total basin storage change, that these estimates compare favorably with those obtained from basin-scale water balances and GRACE data, and that baseflow recession analyses are consistent with simulated changes in groundwater storage. Statistical analyses reveal essentially no relationship between groundwater storage and interannual streamflow anomalies, suggesting that operational seasonal streamflow forecasts, which do not account for groundwater conditions implicitly or explicitly, are likely not detrimentally affected by this omission in the Colorado River basin. </jats:p>', 'doi': '10.5194/hessd-9-13191-2012', 'pages': None, 'publisher': 'Copernicus GmbH', 'tags': None, 'type': 'posted-content', 'url': 'https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/17/1475/2013/hess-17-1475-2013-discussion.html', 'volume': None, 'title': 'On the contribution of groundwater storage to interannual streamflow anomalies in the Colorado River basin', 'journal': None, 'publishedDate': '2012-11-23T01:01:00', 'authors': ['E.

The goal is to fill in gaps of historical data or extend records at streamflow stations no longer in operation or even estimate streamflow at ungauged locations. This is achieved by first selecting relevant stations in the hydrometric network as reference (donor) stations and then using them to infer the missing data. The selection process transforms fully connected streamflow stations in the hydrometric network into a sparsely connected network represented by a precision matrix using a Gaussian graphical model. The underlying graph encodes conditional independence conditions which allow determination of an optimum set of reference stations from the fully connected hydrometric network for a study area. The sparsity of the precision matrix is imposed by using the Graphical Lasso algorithm with an L1-norm regularization parameter and a thresholding parameter. The two parameters are determined by a multi-objective optimization process. In addition, an algorithm based on the conditional independence concept is presented to allow a removal of gauges with the least loss of information. Our approaches are illustrated with daily streamflow data from a hydrometric network of 34 gauges between 1 January 1950 and 31 December 1980 over the Ohio River basin.

The approach has been applied to a Mediterranean subcatchment subject to a variety of natural and anthropogenic pressures. Combining the results from both analytical approaches in selected locations of the basin, the urban/industrial activity was identified as the main pressure on the quality of the surface water resources, and to a large extent also on the groundwater resources, although agriculture may play also an important role, mainly in terms of nitrate and ammonium pollution. Total pesticide concentrations in surface waters were one order of magnitude higher than in groundwaters and believed to originate mainly from soil and/or sediments desorption processes and urban and industrial use, as they were mainly associated with treated wastewaters. These findings are supported by the stable isotope results, that pointed to an organic origin of nitrate in surface waters and most groundwater samples.

Our numerical study shows that the optimization of the hyperparameters can lead to reasonably accurate performance of all models (root mean squared errors of groundwater predictions of 2 meters or less), but the ''simplest'' network, namely a multilayer perceptron (MLP) performs overall better for learning and predicting groundwater data than the more advanced long short-term memory or convolutional neural networks in terms of prediction accuracy and time-to-solution, making the MLP a suitable candidate for groundwater prediction.\", 'doi': 'None', 'authors': ['Juliane Mueller', 'Jangho Park', 'Reetik Sahu', 'Charuleka Varadharajan', 'Bhavna Arora', 'Boris Faybishenko', 'Deborah Agarwal'], 'journal': None, 'tags': ['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'math.OC'], 'comments': 'submitted to Journal of Global Optimization; main paper: 25 pages, 19\\n  figures, 1 table; online supplement: 11 pages, 18 figures, 3 tables', 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10947v3', 'engine': 'arxiv', 'parsed_url': ['http', 'arxiv.org', '/abs/1908.10947v3', '', '', ''], 'img_src': '', 'thumbnail': '', 'priority': '', 'engines': ['arxiv'], 'positions': [4], 'score': 0.25, 'category': 'science', 'pubdate': '2019-08-28 21:18:35', 'query': 'Find research papers on basin-scale water budgets, focusing on the role of groundwater as a stable and important source for streamflow.'}, {'template': 'paper.html', 'content': '<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Columbia River Basin (CRB) is heavily regulated by more than 250\\xa0dams on its river system while depending significantly on groundwater withdrawals in certain sub‚Äêbasins. Neglecting groundwater withdrawals in hydrologic models of the basin could result in inaccurate predictions of its water budget and thus mislead water management decisions in the basin. This study aims to understand the impacts of groundwater pumping on the spatiotemporal patterns of modeling regulated streamflow in the CRB using a modified version of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model integrated with a water management component that accounts for groundwater withdrawals, irrigation demands, and reservoir operation (VIC‚ÄêGIRR). The VIC‚ÄêGIRR simulations showed that considering additional groundwater withdrawals would alleviate the stress of irrigation water deficit in the Snake River Basin with an average reduction of 10\\xa0km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year. Such a reduction in water deficit resulted in slight streamflow increase over the CRB with maximum increase up to 40% during dry period in certain locations. We also note that the implementation of groundwater withdrawal does not, however, improve the overall model performance in long‚Äêterm averaged streamflow and storage predictions. Our results highlight the efforts needed to examine additional important processes in representing the interactions between water withdrawals and reservoir operations. Such efforts will aid in better simulation of multi‚Äêreservoir system and improve effectiveness for agricultural productivity, power generation, flood control, and navigation purposes.</jats:p>', 'doi': '10.1029/2020wr028955', 'pages': None, 'publisher': 'American Geophysical Union (AGU)', 'tags': None, 'type': 'journal-article', 'url': 'https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020WR028955', 'volume': '58', 'title': 'The Role of Groundwater Withdrawals on River Regulation: Example From the Columbia River Basin', 'journal': 'Water Resources Research', 'publishedDate': '2022-06-01T01:00:00', 'authors': ['Hisham Eldardiry', 'Tian Zhou', 'Maoyi Huang', 'Oriana S.

Utilizing data from the preceding 72 hours, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, and discharge values, we developed a generalized model to predict future streamflow. Our approach contrasts with traditional methods that typically rely on location-specific models. We benchmarked the Transformer model's performance against three deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, and Seq2Seq) and the Persistence approach, employing Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), Pearson's r, and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) as metrics. The study reveals the Transformer model's superior performance, maintaining higher median NSE and KGE scores and exhibiting the lowest NRMSE values. This indicates its capability to accurately simulate and predict streamflow, adapting effectively to varying hydrological conditions and geographical variances. Our findings underscore the Transformer model's potential as an advanced tool in hydrological modeling, offering significant improvements over traditional and contemporary approaches.\", 'doi': 'None', 'authors': ['Bekir Z.

Thirty years of continuous daily streamflow records were used in the analysis, including 10 pre‚Äêharvest and 20 post‚Äêharvest years of data. Regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of timber harvest on annual water yield and annual peak discharge. Removal of 14 million board feet of lodgepole pine (<jats:italic>Pinus contorta</jats:italic>) from about 526 hectares (25 percent of the basin) produced an average of 14.7 cm additional water yield per year, or an increase of 52 percent. Mean annual daily maximum discharge also increased by 1.6 cubic meters per second or 66 percent. Increases occurred primarily during the period of May through August with little or no change in wintertime streamflows. Results suggest that clearcutting conifers in relatively large watersheds (&gt; 2000 ha) may produce significant increases in water yield and flooding. Implications of altered streamflow regimes are important for assessing the future ecological integrity of stream ecosystems subject to large‚Äêscale timber harvest and other disturbances that remove a substantial proportion of the forest cover.</jats:p>', 'doi': '10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb03545.x', 'pages': '1187-1196', 'publisher': 'Wiley', 'tags': None, 'type': 'journal-article', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb03545.x', 'volume': '33', 'title': 'EFFECTS OF BASIN‚ÄêSCALE TIMBER HARVEST ON WATER YIELD AND PEAK STREAMFLOW<sup>1</sup>', 'journal': 'JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association', 'publishedDate': '1997-12-01T01:00:00', 'authors': ['Timothy A.
