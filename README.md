# `FactReasoner`: A Probabilistic Approach for Long-Form Factuality

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated vast capabilities on generative tasks in recent years, yet they struggle with guaranteeing the factual correctness of the generated content. This makes these models unreliable in realistic situations where factually accurate responses are expected. In this paper, we propose `FactReasoner`, a new factuality assessor that relies on probabilistic reasoning to assess the factuality of a long-form generated response. Specifically, `FactReasoner` decomposes the response into atomic units, retrieves relevant contexts for them from an external knowledge source, and constructs a joint probability distribution over the atoms and contexts using probabilistic encodings of the logical relationships (entailment, contradiction) between the textual utterances corresponding to the atoms and contexts. `FactReasoner` then computes the posterior probability of whether atomic units in the response are supported by the retrieved contexts.


Assessing the factuality of long form text generations is a challenging problem because these kinds of generations may contain a large number of informative statements and validating each piece of information against one or more reliable sources may be time-consuming, costly and often prone to errors.

Formally, let $y$ be the long form text generated by a large language model $\mathcal{L}$ in response to a query $x$. Following prior work, we assume that $y$ consists of $n$ *atomic units* (or *atoms*) that can be either true or false, denoted by $\mathcal{A}_y = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n\}$. An atomic unit $a_i \in \mathcal{A}_y$ is defined as a short sentence conveying one piece of information. Furthermore, given an external knowledge source $\mathcal{C}$ (e.g., Wikipedia, the Web, or a collection of documents embedded into a vector database), we say that an atomic unit $a_i\in \mathcal{A}_y$ is *supported* by $\mathcal{C}$ if there exists at least one piece of information in $\mathcal{C}$ (e.g., a passage) called a *context* that undebatably supports $a_i$. Otherwise, we say that the atomic unit is *not supported*.

Therefore, the *factual precision* $Pr(y)$ of the response $y$ with respect to a knowledge source $\mathcal{C}$ is defined as:
$$
Pr(y) = \frac{S(y)}{|\mathcal{A}_y|}
$$

where $S(y) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{I}[a_i \textrm{ is supported by } \mathcal{C}]$ is the number of supported atomic units.

Similarly, the notion of *factual recall* (i.e., measuring recall is quite challenging because it is almost impossible to come up with a definite set of atomic units that should be included in a long form response) up to the $K$-th supported atomic unit} denoted by $R_K(y)$ can be defined as follows:
$$
R_K(y) = \min(\frac{S(y)}{K}, 1)
$$

Combining the factual precision and recall at $K$ yields an $F_1$ measure for factuality denoted $F1@K$ as follows:
$$
    F_1@K(y) = \frac{2\cdot Pr(y) \cdot R_K(y)}{Pr(y) + R_K(y)} \textrm{, if } S(y) > 0
$$

Intuitively, $F_1@K(y)$ measures the long-form factuality of a model response $y$ given the numbers of supported and not-supported atomic units in $y$. The parameter $K$ indicates the number of supported atomic units required for a response to achieve full recall. Note that $F_1@K(y) = 0$, if $S(y) = 0$.

`FactReasoner` computes the posterior probabilities $P(a_i)$ and $P(\neg a_i) for each atom. Therefore, in addition to the factual precision $Pr(y)$ and $F_1@K$ measures, we define a new *entropy*-based factuality measure called $\mathcal{E}(y)$ that leverages the posterior probabilities of response $y$'s atoms:
$$
    \mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} -P(a_i) \cdot \log P(a_i)
$$
where $n$ is the number of atomic units in $y$.

Clearly, if all atoms in $\mathcal{A}_y$ have posterior probability $P(a_i) = 0.5$, there is virtually no external information to support or contradict the atoms (we refer to these atoms as *undecided atoms*) then $\mathcal{E}(y) = 0.150515$. On the other hand, if all atoms are true with absolute certainty ($P(a_i) = 1$), then $\mathcal{E}(y) = 0$ and if all atoms are false with absolute certainty then $\mathcal{E}(y) = \infty$. Therefore, when $\mathcal{E}(y)$ is closer to $0$ the response is more truthful.



## The FactReasoner Pipeline

![plot](./pipeline.png)

The `FactReasoner` pipeline for long-form factuality assessment is shown above and consists of four main stages called `Atomizer`, `Reviser`, `Retriever` and `Evaluator`, respectively. It takes as input a response $y$ and outputs the marginal posterior probabilities $P(a_i)$ of $y$'s atomic units together with the factuality measures described earlier, such as $Pr(y)$, $F_1@K(y)$ and $\mathcal{E}(y)$, respectively.

The `Atomizer` prompts an LLM to decompose the response $y$ into a set of $n$ atomic units $\mathcal{A}_y$ by applying any of the decomposition strategies proposed recently. Subsequently, the `Reviser` also uses an LLM to revise the atoms such that the pronouns, unknown entities, or incomplete names are replaced with their corresponding named entities in the response. Next, the `Retriever` is responsible for querying an external knowledge source to retrieve the contexts relevant to the response's atoms. At this stage, we can simply use the atoms' utterances as queries or prompt an LLM to generate them. Finally, the `Evaluator` constructs the probabilistic graphical model representing the logical relationships between the atoms and contexts, and assess $y$'s factuality via probabilistic reasoning.

Depending on what relationships between atoms and contexts are considered, we define three versions of the `FactReasoner` pipeline, as follows:

* `FactReasoner 1` (`FR1`):
In this case, for each atom variable $A_i$ up to $k$ most relevant contexts $\{C_1^i, ..., C_k^i\}$ are retrieved and only the relationships between atom $A_i$ and its corresponding contexts are considered, namely only the factors $f(A_i,C_j^i)$ are created (where $j=1..k$).

* `FactReasoner 2` (`FR2`):
This version also retrieves up to $k$ contexts for each atom $A_i$, but it subsequently removes any duplicated contexts, thus resulting in $m$ unique contexts denoted by $\{C_1, ..., C_m\}$. It then considers the relationships between atom $A_i$ and all $m$ contexts, creating the factors $f(A_i, C_j)$, where $j=1..m$.

* `FactReasoner` 3 (`FR3`): In this version, we consider the same contexts $\{C_1, ..., C_m\}$ as in `FR2`, but in addition to the atom-context relationships we also consider the context-context relationships. Thus, we create the factors $f(A_i,C_j)$ as well as the factors $f(C_j,C_k)$, where $j=1..m$ and $k=1..m$ and $j\neq k$, respectively.

## Installation Instructions
For development and running experiments, we need to create a Python 3.10 
environment that contains the required dependencies. This can be done easily by
cloning the `fm-factual` git repository, creating a conda environment with Python 3.10
and installing the `fm-factual` package in that environment, as follows:

```
git clone git@github.ibm.com:IBM-Research-AI/fm-factual.git
cd fm-factual
conda create -n factual python=3.10
conda activate factual
pip install -e .
```

In addition, `FactReasoner` relies on an external probabilistic reasoning engine. We use the open-source C++ `merlin` probabilistic inference library available [here](https://github.com/radum2275/merlin). The C++ library needs to be compiled locally and the path to the binary must be provided as a CLI argument to the `FactReasoner` assessor.

## Input File Format
The input files processed by `FactReasoner` are `jsonl` files with the following format:

* `input`: the input prompt used to generate the output response
* `output`: the LLM generated long-form response
* `topic`: an optional field indicating the topic of the prompt/response
* `atoms`: the list of atomic units corresponding to the response. Each atom is a dictionary containing an `id`, the original text (`original`), the revised/decontextualized text (`text`) and a list of relevant context ids (`contexts`). If the atom is labeled, then a `label` field is also present with the following values: `S` - supported and `NS` - not supported.
* `contexts`: the list of contexts (retrieved for the atoms). Each context is a dictionary containing an `id`, a `title`, a `snippet` (optional), a `link` (optional) and the actual `text` of the context.
