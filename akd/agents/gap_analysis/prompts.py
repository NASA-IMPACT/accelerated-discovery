section_grouper_inst = '''I have a structured list of section titles from a scientific paper, and I want you to group them into logical sections. Each group should represent a distinct part of the document, starting with the title, followed by related subsections if present. Here's an example:

Input Example:
['KnowledgeHub: An End-to-End Tool for Assisted Scientific Discovery',
'Abstract',
'1 Introduction',
'2 System Description',
'2.1 Document Ingestion',
'2.2 Annotation',
'2.3 Question Answering',
'3 Use-case: Knowledge Discovery for the Battery Domain',
'4 Conclusion',
'Ethical Statement',
'Acknowledgments',
'References']

Output Example:
[['KnowledgeHub: An End-to-End Tool for Assisted Scientific Discovery'], ['Abstract'], ['1 Introduction'], ['2 System Description', '2.1 Document Ingestion', '2.2 Annotation', '2.3 Question Answering'], ['3 Use-case: Knowledge Discovery for the Battery Domain'], ['4 Conclusion'], ['Ethical Statement'], ['Acknowledgments'], ['References']]

## Key Sections
`['introduction', 'related work or background', 'methodology', 'experiments, models and datasets', 'results and discussions', 'limitations', 'future work', 'conclusion', 'appendix', 'misc']`

---

## Instructions
1. Assign each section title to the most appropriate key section based on its content and context.
2. If a section title does not clearly fit into one of the predefined key sections, group it under **`misc`**.
3. Sometimes, there are sections between introduction/related work and experiments/discuss that may be related to methodology. Group accordingly.
4. If there are no sections under a particular key, leave the list empty.
5. Use the following example mappings as a guide to your decisions:

## Input
[List of section titles]

### Example Input
['Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Palm Fruit Maturity Classification *', '1 Introduction', '2 Related Work', '3 Proposed Method', 'Background', '4 Experiments', '5 Limitations', '6 Discussion and Conclusion', '7 References']

---

## Output
A dictionary where each key is a key section, and the value is a list of section titles grouped under that key.
Only provide a JSON dictionary as output. Do not include any explanation or text outside of the dictionary.


### Example Output
'introduction': ['1 Introduction'],
'related work or background': ['2 Related Work', 'Background'],
'methodology': ['3 Proposed Method'],
'experiments, models and datasets': ['4 Experiments'],

summarise_answer_inst = '''You are a helpful AI assistant skilled at crafting detailed, engaging, and well-structured answers. You excel at summarizing and extracting relevant information to generate accurate, clear, and well-cited answers.

Given a query and a dictionary where the key is a `source_id` and the value is an answer generated from the `source` for the query, your task is to provide answers that are:
- **Informative and relevant**: Thoroughly address the user's query using the data present in the sources.
- **Well-structured**: Present information concisely and logically.
- **Cited and credible**: Use inline citations with [number] notation to refer to the context source(s) for each fact or detail included.

### Formatting Instructions
- **Tone and Style**: Maintain a neutral, journalistic tone with engaging narrative flow.
- **Markdown Usage**: Format your response with Markdown for clarity. Use headings, subheadings, bold text, and italicized words when needed to enhance readability.
- **Length and Depth**: Avoid superficial responses and strive for depth without unnecessary repetition.

### Citation Requirements
- **Inline Citations**: Cite every single fact, statement, or sentence using [number] notation corresponding to the source from the provided `context`. For example:  
  - "The Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited landmarks in the world [1]."
- **Citation Syntax**: Use multiple sources for a single detail where applicable. For example:  
  - "Paris is a cultural hub, attracting millions of visitors annually [1][2]."
- **Source List**: Include a "Sources" section at the end of the response that lists each source in detail. Format the sources like this:
  - `[1] source_id_1`
  - `[2] source_id_2`

### General Instructions
- If any information is unsupported by the sources, clearly indicate the limitation.
- Ensure every fact in your response is linked to its respective source using the specified format.
- Organize the source list in numerical order for easy reference.
