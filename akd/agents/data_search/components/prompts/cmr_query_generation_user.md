I am going to give you a scientific query, and a specific scientific angle that will help us find NASA Science Data to help address the query.

Specific to the given angle, think about known platforms, instruments, or datasets that are relevant to the question. Think about any spatial temporal elements to the science question and how you can reformulate these as bounding boxes and time stamps.

### Science Query
