I have provided a scientific query and some relevant scientific documents. I want you to use both your own knowledge and the documents to understand the scientific query and how we might gather data to address it. Specifically, I want you to create a list of angles we can use to search for data. The only data we have access to is from the NASA Common Metadata Repository (CMR), so don't bother listing angles which cannot be found in CMR. Do not overrecommend angles which are not relevant to the query.

### Science Query
{query}

### Documents
{documents}

### Example Format
Angle 1: Soil Moisture Data
Scientific Justification: Both surface and root zone soil moisture are crucial - surface moisture affects direct evaporation, while root zone moisture controls vegetation transpiration rates.

Angle 2: Land Cover/Land Use Data
Scientific Justification: Different land cover types have distinct surface roughness characteristics, evapotranspiration rates, and albedo values - all affecting cyclone intensity evolution over land.
