I have provided a scientific query and some relevant scientific documents. I want you to use both your own knowledge and the documents to understand the scientific query and how we might gather data to address it. Specifically, I want you to create a list of angles we can use to search for data.

### Science Query

### Example Format
Angle 1: Soil Moisture Data
Scientific Justification: Both surface and root zone soil moisture are crucial - surface moisture affects direct evaporation, while root zone moisture controls vegetation transpiration rates.

Angle 2: Land Cover/Land Use Data
Scientific Justification: Different land cover types have distinct surface roughness characteristics, evapotranspiration rates, and albedo values - all affecting cyclone intensity evolution over land.
