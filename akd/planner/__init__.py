"""
AKD Planner Module

This module provides LLM-based workflow planning and execution capabilities
for the Accelerated Knowledge Discovery (AKD) framework.

Core Components:
- PlannerOrchestrator: Main entry point for unified planner operations
- ResearchPlanner: High-level research planning with agent discovery
- WorkflowPlanner: LLM-based workflow generation with reasoning traces
- AgentAnalyzer: Agent capability analysis and compatibility assessment
- LangGraphWorkflowBuilder: LangGraph-based workflow execution
- Core Services: Centralized services for LLM, agents, and validation
