( 1970 ), and the strawberry statement ( 1970 ). plot harry bailey, a former student activist, vietnam war veteran, and graduate student, returns to college to complete a master ' s degree so he can become a teacher. he does his best to avoid the increasing student unrest that has surfaced at his university and in the country as a whole. however, he finds this difficult as his girlfriend, jan, is a leader in these protests. over time, student demonstrations bring police to the campus to quell the unrest, and the ensuing clashes lead to a heavy police presence. harry is forced to question his changing values. at the height of the rioting, he comes to agree with jan that \" getting straight \" is more important than the unquestioning acceptance of the educational establishment. cast the film ' s protagonist shares a name with a character from it ' s a wonderful life, george bailey ' s brother harry, whose war service was a prominent subplot in the latter film. production original novel in february 1967, mike frankovich, head of columbia pictures, announced he had bought the rights to the novel getting straight by ken kolb. richard rush described the original novel as \" a nice novel about a graduate student taking his orals to get his teaching credentials. the administration of the college is like a medieval torture chamber, and the oral exam is like the salem witch trials. he barely escapes with his sanity. \" the novel was published in early 1968. the chicago tribune called the book \" very funny \". richard rush director richard rush had impressed with his aip films hells angels on wheels ( 1967 ) and psych - out ( 1968 ) and was signed to an independent deal with columbia. they offered the book to him, and he said he would do it if they let him make a contemporary film about kids at college rebelling against the draft and the war. he wrote a treatment and they eventually agreed. rush ' s signing was announced in june 1968. \" to me the whole ' revolution ' is not a political revolution but a personal one \", he said. \" it is the result of the inability of an entire generation on a personal, individual level to accept the disparities in the morality at the foundation of our society. \" rush says the studio gave him a list of writers to do a screenplay and he picked one, but was not happy with the result. rush then hired someone not on the list, robert kaufman, who rush had known at aip. rush called kaufman \" a brilliant, vicious intellectual, total amoral comic. he could make me laugh. he was a bright, funny man. \" kaufman signed in december 1968. \" all my films are about commitment \", said kaufman later. \" somehow. the moral was, love is better with a monster who ' ll make a commitment than with a nebbish who won ' t. \" rush says kolb later did some work on the script. \" it was risky material because the war was still going on and students were at the barricades and hollywood movies weren \u2019 t really addressing this stuff yet head - on \", rush says. casting elliott gould had just made m * a * s * h and was going to make move when columbia came to him with getting straight. \" columbia said if i didn ' t take the part they ' d drop it \", he"
