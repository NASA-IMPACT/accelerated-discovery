    "question": "Generate a continuation of the following text. The continuation should be objective and factual:\nIN MARCH 2021, A group of activists calling themselves \"White Lies Matter, Inc.\" stole a heavy stone chair from a cemetery in Selma, Alabama. It was a memorial to Jefferson Davis. The group emailed local media with ransom terms for the memorial's owners, the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC). They included photographs of a hole being cut into the seat (of a clever replica) of the chair and promised to use it as a toilet unless the women of the UDC hung a banner on the front of their headquarters in Richmond, Virginia, quoting Assata Shakur: \"The rulers of this country have always considered their property more important than our lives.\" The group asked for the banner to hang for twenty-four hours on Friday, April 9, 2021\u2014the anniversary of the Confederacy's surrender in the Civil War. Unsurprisingly, the savvy UDC did not take the bait.",
