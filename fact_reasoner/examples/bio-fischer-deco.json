    "input": "Question: Tell me a bio of Gerhard Fischer (inventor).",
    "output": "Gerhard Fischer is an inventor and entrepreneur who is best known for inventing the first handheld, battery-operated metal detector in 1931. He was born on July 23, 1904, in Frankfurt, Germany, and moved to the United States in 1929, where he became a citizen in 1941.\n\nFischer's metal detector was originally designed to find and remove nails and other metal debris from wood used in construction projects. However, it soon became popular among treasure hunters looking for buried artifacts and coins.\n\nIn addition to his work on metal detectors, Fischer also invented a number of other devices, including a waterproof flashlight and a portable radio receiver. He founded the Fischer Research Laboratory in 1936, which became one of the leading manufacturers of metal detectors in the world.\n\nFischer received numerous awards and honors for his inventions, including the Thomas A. Edison Foundation Gold Medal in 1987. He passed away on February 23, 1995, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and entrepreneurship.",
